Didn't go down the beans and rice aisle.   My child said ""this is because of the coronavirus isn't it?""  Yes.

8,Don't Discount Food Safety,"The last thing you want if food poisoning while bugging in, and a lot of the prepper staples are ones you gotta watch out for. 

Dried Beans - some raw soaked or undercooked beans can give you trouble. Please read up on how to avoid this. There is a toxin called Phytohaemagglutinin in raw beans that must be deactivated by being cooked at a high enough temperature. 

Rice, pasta, potatoes - Bacillus cereus loves it some room temp rice. B.cereus is one of the types of food poisoning whose spores and toxins are not rendered harmless by recooking so its important to either keep rice very hot or cool it quick, and not wait too long to eat it (it freezes well though!) - B. cereus is also a risk on other starchy foods like pasta and potatoes. 

I'm not seeing as much freezer prepping, but its worth investing in a food thermometer anyway, just in case. Cook meat to safe temps. Defrost carefully and avoid cross contamination.

Keep hot foods hot, and cool quickly. Do not leave your food out. Be careful batch cooking starches, unless you know you'll eat it in a few days or freeze it.

It's really worth reading up on food safety especially if you're newer to cooking. The last thing you want to do while bugging in with your family and trying to avoid the hospital is get food poisoning.

[https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep-food-safe](https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep-food-safe) is a good place to start.

24,Favorite recipes using only shelf stable foods,"We keep about an extra week to two weeks of food on hand at all times just because there are weeks when we just don't make it to a grocery store. We're also avid campers and I prefer to not need to restock on ice every day, so I have collected recipes that can be made from shelf stable ingredients. 

Fully shelf stable

* White Chili ( [https://www.campingdude.com/content/recipe/white\_chicken\_chili-432.asp](https://www.campingdude.com/content/recipe/white_chicken_chili-432.asp), best with onion in it, but you could substitute onion powder)
* Spam and Potatoes ( [https://koa.com/camping-recipes/spam-dinner/](https://koa.com/camping-recipes/spam-dinner/) , substitute canned potatoes if necessary)
* Tuna Helper (follow instructions on packaging)
* Beans and weiners ( [https://www.cooks.com/recipe/328eg8o5/nellies-baked-beans-and-vienna-sausage.html](https://www.cooks.com/recipe/328eg8o5/nellies-baked-beans-and-vienna-sausage.html) )
* Tuna Casserole ( [https://www.food.com/recipe/tuna-casserole-13630](https://www.food.com/recipe/tuna-casserole-13630) , skip the celery, use canned mushrooms)

Requires a fridge or freezer, but assuming no major power outages, the ingredients should be fine for 4 weeks

* Kielbasa (pan fried) and shells and cheese (boxed). Kielbasa generally doesn't expire for a month after purchase)
* Tacos (use frozen ground beef, powdered taco seasoning, hard taco shells, jarred salsa, and frozen guacamole. Top with shredded cheddar- which stays good for several weeks, longer if you grate your own cheese)
* Pot Stickers (Boil frozen pot stickers. Usually comes with its own dipping sauce)
* Spaghetti and Meatballs (dry pasta, jarred marinara, frozen meatballs, parmesan. If one jar of sauce is not quite enough, you can stretch it by adding a can of tomatoes)
* Crockpot chicken with corn, beans and Salsa (1 can black beans, 1 jar salsa, 1 jar corn, 3-4 frozen chicken breasts- dump into crockpot on low and cook for 8hrs)
* Easy Thai-inspired stir fry (Stir fry asian mix of frozen vegetables with frozen chicken. Add 1 can coconut milk and Mae Ploy brand curry paste to taste. Serve with rice)
* Vegetable Alfredo Pasta (Stir fry mixed vegetables, add a jar of Alfredo sauce and heat, serve over cooked bowtie or penne pasta)

Maybe this will help someone in figuring out what to prep. We have ingredients for almost all of those meals on hand most of the time (I think we're out of jarred alfredo sauce and potstickers right now, but otherwise I could make any of those meals tonight). The best part is that you can recombine the taco and white chili ingredients into taco soup ( [https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16678/slow-cooker-taco-soup/](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16678/slow-cooker-taco-soup/) )or the ground beef and coconut milk into Thai ground beef ( [https://www.food.com/recipe/thai-style-ground-beef-150739](https://www.food.com/recipe/thai-style-ground-beef-150739) ) with the same ingredients.

26,5th day with confirmed case in Switzerland,"First sorry for not writing this earlier but yesterday I was pretty busy prepping and organizing my stuff.

So in the grocery store while a few days ago it was only a few shelves with canned food emptied, now there started to have entire sections empty.

Pasta, instant soup, sugar, floor, canned food, hand sanitizer etc are all gone or only a few items are left.

People have definitely started massively stockpiling and apparently they told on TV to not panic and stockpile too much to make sure it doesn't create disruption in the supply.

There are some rumors that the interdiction of gathering for events with more than 1000 people will be extended to events with 500 people already.

A few important events have been canceled and I personally can't believe that the ban will be lifted in middle of March. I think it will be extended at least until June in the coming days based on what happened in other countries.

Since the first case a few days ago we have a slow increase but I expect next week to be much bigger with local transmissions.

29,"Don't just hoard food, PREP food! A thought experiment on what would happen if you'd get ill.","A few observations:

1. This sub is *filled* with pictures/stories of people stocking up on canned food and such. 
2. Every now and then, people mention (without actually discussing it much further) 'be sure to know how to actually prepare your food' and every single time, it's met with too many people saying they have little to no experience knowing how to cook. 

Here's the thing: preparing for pandemic-type situations has two sides to it. First, you prepare yourself to **stay healthy** throughout the ordeal (and potential quarantine that goes along with it). Second, you prepare to **deal with being ill** if you *do* happen to contract the illness and you can't necessarily depend on hospital services etc. because they are overburdened.

My point of this post is the discuss the second topic: what happens if you *do* get ill? Luckily, if you are a healthy, younger individual, the disease isn't life threatening and is 'nothing more' than a really bad, extended flu. You can - and should - deal with this in self-quarantine, provide you don't develop additional (life-threatening) symptoms. 

So, when is the last time you had the flu? Do you remember what it was like? Maybe you even had a flu this winter during the flu season! Here's the recap: you will feel like absolute, utter SHIT for a good 1-2 weeks in which you will most likely be bed bound, with little to no energy to do anything else but walk yourself from bed to bathroom to relief yourself and maybe take a quick shower every now and then. Based on how contagious COVID-19 is, it's a good thing to assume that likely your whole family will be down simultaneously if one of you gets infected as well, so there's little opportunity one of you will stay healthy enough to take care of the others.

With the lack of a vaccine or other targeted meds, the best you can do to fight off the illness is help your body and its immune system to stay in top form fighting condition. This means staying hydrated and providing your body with optimized nutrition. 

It's great having a pantry full of food, but if you are ill to a point that you can barely stand up for more than 10 minutes, you won't be able to find the energy to cook proper meals for you and your family through your illness. You'll have to eat though, so what happens..? you'll do the minimum you can muster: boil some rice, drain it, open a can of beans, pour it on top. 

Sure, it's food, but it's not the kind of optimized nutrition your body can use right now! Having a storage pantry is a great prep for when you're healthy, but preparing for illness *does* require some additional thought and effort.

A key part of my preps is making sure that my freezer is stored with **1-2 weeks worth of portioned off, ready to eat home made food**. You could of course buy ready-to-eat meals, but by making them yourself you can make way, way healthier meals packed with premium nutrients that your body needs when ill. These shouldn't be your basic rice + bean dishes (although even that would be better than having nothing prepped): these should be your rice, bean, extra veggie/extra nuts/extra seeds/extra spices (spiced have health properties!)/whatever you want to pack into the dish for health reasons.

When you get ill, you simply pull out a few containers out of the freezer the day before, put them in the fridge to defrost, and the next day, you just pop them in the microwave and be done with it. Zero effort with a high quality meal as a result.

Learning how to cook **NOW** and practicing those skills now can help you build a stockpile of meals in your freezer for those times when you can't cook yourself. 

If you want to take it a step further: I also keep little containers with measured out portions of fruit for smoothies in my freezer. Frozen fruit keeps well and smoothies can be made when you start noticing you getting ill (and kept either in the fridge or frozen in mason jars). Same story: it makes sure you can easily consume nutritious, high quality food you body needs but you probably can't easily access in your state. 

Another more advanced tip: Learn how to bake and how to make your own granola bars without too much added sugar/honey. These can also be frozen! On those days when you'll feel at your absolute worst and you feel too ill to even eat, you can eat these tiny nutrient rich calorie bombs to make sure you at least get *something* into your system. When you notice you're getting ill, take them out and keep them in a container next to your bed over the course of your illness, just in case. 

**Other tips**

- Prepare a little 'dealing with illness' basket for each bedroom/person in the house: make sure that each person can have easy access to their own stack of meds (if old enough for self administration), tissues, snacks, 2L of water (bottles are useful to track sufficient water intake and make sure you're not getting dehydrated).
- Prep a list of phone numbers etc. of COVID-19 specific services in your country and check what the procedures are on who to contact if you get infected. You won't have the energy to deal with this trivial bullshit when you're actually ill. 
- Once you *suspect* you might be ill, SELF-QUARANTINE IMMEDIATELY. Seriously. Don't go to the grocery store to fetch some more bananas or whatever because you think you might be getting ill tomorrow. If you are a carrier, you are a walking infection; you owe it to society to take responsibility and stay put. This is why you prepped.

44,Prepping when you have a relative in a long term care facility?,"My mom is in a really nice Assisted Living facility, so most of her everyday needs are met without my even being there. At least, under normal circumstances. And they’ve been very conscientious about trying to prevent and contain infectious illnesses in the past. I know they would do the best they could if she caught the corona thing. But I worry that it could overwhelm the systems they have in place, and mine. Plus, what if I get sick and can’t do the things I normally do for her? I’m in my 60s, an only child and her power of attorney. i’m wondering how other people are planning to deal with things.

I saw news about cases at a long term facility in Washington state. One story said vendor deliveries have been stopped. I’m assuming UPS and Fedex deliveries wouldn’t be delivering there either? In the past if I were sick or something, I could call the local drugstore and have supplies delivered to her. Or I could order things from Walmart or Amazon and have them shipped direct to her. But that might not work if SHTF. So I feel like I should stock up what I can, right in her room.

And how would they even get refills of normal maintenance drugs in, if no vendor deliveries? And food?

I normally bring her personal laundry home to wash. I don’t want to transport a virus either direction. Should I start using Lysol laundry sanitizer on everything? And, normally if I were sick or on vacation, I could arrange for them to do it a couple of weeks (for a fee). But if their staff became overwhelmed with taking care of sick people and sanitizing everything, would they even be able to do it?

Plus there’s the aspect of being responsible for someone’s finances. I worry about what would happen if I couldn’t manage. My husband would be overwhelmed just taking over our own household’s paperwork if I were in the hospital or died. So there’s a family friend who is my mother’s alternate POA.

51,My favorite GoTo meal. Recipe and instructions on how to cook it to prepare BEFORE getting sick.,"It is chicken and veggie soup, of course! Easily made vegetarian or heartier depending on what you need/want/have. I prefer the meatier the better to stock up on protein and fat when I feel awful and simply cannot cook. 

(Sorry if formatting stinks. I’m on mobile and I’ll edit it later on my computer.)

Now, I make at least a gallon of this at a time, can in, store it in the fridge/freezer, and then I feel like I am set for months. Granted it never lasts that long due to delicio-city, but I try!

Ingredients:
- 1 whole chicken (bone in) (frozen or not, doesn’t matter)
- 1 - 2 celery bunches 
- 4 - 5 large carrots
- 1 - 2 parsley bunches 
- 1 - 2 leeks, dark green leaves cut off
- handful or pinch of peppercorn (depends on how “spicy” you like it - I tend to do more to clear my sinuses) 
- 4 - 5 allspice (a little goes a long way with this)
- 2 - 3 bay leaves
- heck ton of salt (at least multiple tablespoons, but up to your taste ultimately) 
- rice (for later)

To cook:
- Find the biggest stock pot you got, hopefully at least 8 quarts (2 gallons), or whatever you have. If you need multiple pots - one for chicken, one for veggies - do it!
- Get your chicken in the water and start boiling, once you’ve reached big bubbles, turn down the heat to simmer with smaller bubbles (this can take awhile depending on how big the pot is, if your chicken is frozen, how good of a stovetop you have, etc)
- Now, you’ll be getting some “foam/scum” starting to form on top. You can either scoop this off or leave it. It is simply denatured protein from boiling your chicken. I feel like extra protein can be good, but it also turns your soup more cloudy and grey at the end - dealer’s choice! 
- While your chicken is stewing, clean your veggies and throw them in! If you DON’T want the protein foam in your soup, wait until AFTER the chicken is good and boiled and foam scraped off. I leave my veggies whole to deal with them easier later.
- Throw your spices and salt in, cover, turn heat low, and leave it to cook for hours! I tend to let it go for at least two, but really depends on the state of your veggies. My goal is to drain all the life and nutrients out of them and into the soup! So make them look soggy and dull!

Ok! So you’re going to have lots of soup after this! How to keep it and eat it:

- I typically drain the soup to not have any meat or veggies in it and can it. You can follow the “official” directions: [National Center for Home Food Preservation ](https://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_04/soups.html) or try someone else at your own at your own risk. I typically do a simple boil in a water bath since I’m sticking these in the fridge (or freezer).
- the leftover veggies can be good for substance in the soup, but I throw them into my compost! I only save the chunks of chicken, they’re completely falling off the bones at this point and can be rather tasteless, but again it’s your choice about how much “substance” you want in the soup. Use them for something so as not to waste! Maybe fried rice? Soy sauce does wonders to make things tasty. 
- NOTE! Do not keep the chicken bones in your soup overnight! It will turn into a slimy, gelatinous mess! I’ve warned you... it’s pretty gross and seems to change the taste. I’m not a fan. 
- After all is said and done and you’re feeling like death - you can easily just microwave a cup and drink away! This helps sooo much with most sicknesses - I particularly love it after vomiting or diarrhea because of the high fat and salt content. You can water it down to be milder OR!! MY FAVORITE:
- Cook your rice into it! Same ratio of 2:1 liquid:rice and then you have a sick person’s dream! It’ll fill you up and give you a huge nutrient boost. Seriously, a little goes such a long way.
- Also, for young children, if they’re eating solids - simply mash/purée the rice and soup mixture and your kiddos will be feeling goooood. 

I grew up on this soup and have used it for so many things like the flu, after I got teeth removed (definitely purée the rice so nothing gets into the open wounds), and simply when I feel starved and don’t want to work hard. I have it constantly in stock since me, my husband, and kiddo LOVE it so much. You can pick and choose what to keep or throw in, but this is my original version. Cook beans into it instead of chicken. Throw extra veggies in you love. Take out ones your don’t. Season with MSG (my mother always used Vegeta when I was a kid). Purée all the veggies into it for a thicker, heartier soup! Anything goes, just boil a bunch of goodies.

I’ve also made this from canned goods, dehydrated foods, bouillon cubes, a mix of everything. It’s, of course, best with the fresh stuff, but works just as well with dried or canned! Perfect for preparedness or when you’re stuck with only your stash. 

Good luck and let me know if you have any questions!!

52,"For those who have fully prepped now for Coronavirus, tell us what you have?","I've been prepping since January when there weren't yet any cases of Covid-19 outside of China. I've been slowly adding to my stockpile weekly since then and I finally feel as though I'm fully prepared. At least, as prepared as I'm comfortable being.

Some context:I am a minor, and financially dependent on my parents,and also in probably one of the worst countries possible for this epidemic, Pakistan, and Pakistan has close relations with china, lots of people from china come here,the general services here are really bad, theres also congestion in traffic and living space, houses, the country definitely aren't equipped to deal with what could potentially happen, and people here tend to riot when shit hits he fan, so i probably am in the worst case scenario

54,"If you're a coffee lover, definitely consider this.","We like coffee in my home. I personally can't stand coffee without creamer in it. So if you're like me, don't forget that you can freeze coffee creamer to keep good for later.

100% do NOT freeze coffee creamer in a plastic ice tray. You will hate yourself later when you try to get it out. Coffee creamer will not freeze completely solid, it will still be a bit tacky (if that's the right word to use for it) and will be difficult to get out. Use a silicone ice tray/mold. This way you can actually push the coffee creamer cube out easily.

I've done this before, and if you pop the cube in your coffee let it melt a bit and stir it around, it's just the same as pouring in coffee creamer.

Also, places like WinCo sell coffee beans in bulk. They have a grinder next to the coffee beans so you can grind them in store, but if you have a grinder at home or even just a powerful blender (I've ground coffee with a ninja blender before) you can grind it at home later.

about this virus. And still, Walmart is completely out of bleach, gloves, hand sanitizer, and large

66,Does anyone else here live paycheck to paycheck and has dipped into their credit in order to do some prep?,"Reading through a lot of posts listing prepped items and suggested items, I find myself wondering if most people here are just super well off $? 


I had my credit card debt paid off last year, but I deal with a chronic illness which has left me on a (low) fixed income. My SO has a good paying job which is currently supporting most of our needs, but we are hardly ever left with any savings, (if you can call it that as there are school loans &amp; car payments that seem never ending). 


I read of/see impressive prep stashes and then mention of cash, cheques, enough savings to go for 2,3,6 or more months being noted/recommended. 


Not to mention people who have already left their jobs/started isolation.


That seems like it's unattainable for us! 

I have to say, we are much better off than a lot of our peers our age (late twenties).

(However, most of our peers are not even interested in the corona outbreak despite it only being a few hours from where we live).


In order to prep basic items, even before the comfort/want items, using credit was the only option. 


I don't regret it as I can't eat dollar bills when I'm hungry, and require my medication no matter the financial consequence, but I don't see any discussion concerning future debt.


I know the dollar is crashing, and I'm pretty sure we are headed into the next depression/recession. I don't really know what that will mean for us in the future other than money will be more tight than it already is? Will we be able to afford basic things like utilities?

68,I'm glad I was the 'paranoid' friend and family member,"I've been following this since the middle of January and I've gotten more and more concerned. I kept it to myself more-or-less until two weeks ago when I saw that shit was going to hit the fan. I told all of my friends and family to prep, and I gave them a laundry list of reasons why so it didn't seem like I was pulling it out of my ass. Thankfully I had plenty of material from here and the other covid-19 subreddits. I ended my message by saying 'I'm happy for you to call me chicken little for the rest of my life if things blow over.' I only sent this to my immediate family and close friends. I also bought them all reusable masks over 1.5 months ago and just gave them to everyone yesterday. Two weeks ago they were reluctant, but everyone stocked up on essentials. Today, several of them went on second trips and were shocked that stuff like bleach and sanitizer were sold out. I'm just so relieved that I know they're mostly prepared and actually took me seriously. My dad is in the most high-risk range and he's decided to stay at home until things get better.

Funny enough, convincing my boyfriend to prep was the most difficult. He's a lawyer and loves to argue. He really pushed my buttons when I was bringing up the different things that were concerning me the most, but he humored me and let me help him prep food/essentials last week. I did tell him that if shit hit the fan, I'm going to frame ""I told you so"" on his wall lol.

When someone is diagnosed as having the virus, the people they had contact with are tracked down and isolated.

If you have a stubborn friend or family member declaring “I won’t get sick” or “It’s not that bad, the flu is worse”, tell them that the government is not forcibly quarantining people with the flu.

If you are one of those people who unknowingly crossed paths with an infected person (which you have no control over because it’s only later that you find out they are infected), you will be quarantined either in an isolation unit or your own home.

This also includes removal of attendance from your school, workplace and daily routine. Your whole life could be put on pause at ANY time, with no warning, for the next few weeks.

Anyone reading this could be contacted and quarantined the moment an infected person says “Oh and then I saw [person reading this] the same week I was diagnosed” making you a target for immediate isolation.

80,"Many here are wondering if they have enough, here's how to estimate if you do","Like many here I go on hoarding sprees, then feel silly that i'm prepping at all, then get scared that I don't have enough.

Here's how to know if you have enough basics (for a WFPB diet) grains and beans:

list all the type of graisn you have stocked up, lookup the portion per person, then estimate how muh serving that will give you out of a typical pack.

I'm from europe so all these calcuations are in metric system for a 1kilo pack

portion     product      servings in 1kilo
70g          rice              14
70g          pasta           14
60g          beans           16
140g        bread            7
45g          oats             22
60g          buckwheat    16
70g          couscous       14

so there's 2 of us, so for example that means we need 4 servings per day for meals, and 2 servings of morning oats/bread

so for example we'd need 56 meal servings and 28 breakfast servings to fulfill a 14days quarantine.

on a WFPB diet, I count that as 56 servings of whole grain + 56 servings of beans + 56 servings of vegetables or dried soup; and 28 servings of oats + 14 fruits split in two and sliced (our usual) + almond butter delayed in water. (a jar usually lasts us a couple of months)

so count your stock, evaluate the number of servings that fills, and you know for how long you have enough

As a reference, Wuhan has been quarantined for 40 days now, so we can expect a worse case scenario of at least as long. Best case scenario would be a 14days quarantine, so you need at least as much.",PandemicPreps,1583162073,SecretPassage1,11,1,True,2020-03-02 07:14:33,like many go hoarding sprees feel silly prepping get scared enough know enough basics wfpb diet grains beans type graisn stocked lookup portion per person estimate muh serving give typical pack europe calcuations metric system kilo pack product servings kilo g rice g pasta g beans g bread g oats g buckwheat g couscous us example means need servings per day meals servings morning oats bread example need meal servings breakfast servings fulfill days quarantine wfpb diet count servings whole grain servings beans servings vegetables dried soup servings oats fruits split two sliced usual almond butter delayed water jar usually lasts us couple months count stock evaluate number servings fills know long enough reference wuhan quarantined days expect worse case scenario least long best case scenario would days quarantine need least much,like mani go hoard spree feel silli prep get scare enough know enough basic wfpb diet grain bean type graisn stock lookup portion per person estim muh serv give typic pack europ calcuat metric system kilo pack product serv kilo g rice g pasta g bean g bread g oat g buckwheat g couscou us exampl mean need serv per day meal serv morn oat bread exampl need meal serv breakfast serv fulfil day quarantin wfpb diet count serv whole grain serv bean serv veget dri soup serv oat fruit split two slice usual almond butter delay water jar usual last us coupl month count stock evalu number serv fill know long enough refer wuhan quarantin day expect wors case scenario least long best case scenario would day quarantin need least much

84,"LPT: Buy a bidet, not toilet paper","I've had a bidet attachment for my toilet for about 2 years.  It's more hygenic, more environmentally friendly, more comfortable, and much faster than using toilet paper.  I use toilet paper to dry for convenience, but in a shortage washcloths would work just fine.  Mine cost about $30 on Amazon, which is like 1-2 months worth of toilet paper.

85,"Excellent Post on ""WHY"" and ""HOW"" to prep by an Epidemiologist. Great to share with friends and family on the fence - maybe it will save a few lives and slow down spread.","One of the best pieces of writing on this matter. 

-----

Hi folks,

A number of you have asked me what I think is going to happen with coronavirus (COVID-19) and what we should be doing to prepare. I have a few thoughts about what’s likely to happen and what you should do about it. For those of you who don’t know me well, I am a preventive medicine physician and infectious disease epidemiologist. I graduated from the CDC’s Epidemic Intelligence Service and have over 17 years of experience in the field, most of that with CDC.

Wishing everyone good health,

Juliana

Who should you listen to?

The CDC and your state health department are your best place for information about COVID-19. (Listen to them before you listen to me.) Be cautious about other sources of information - many of them will not be reliable or accurate.

How bad is this going to be?

It’s possible that COVID-19 will be similar to a bad flu year but there are a number of indications that it will be very much like the 1918 Flu Pandemic. To put that in perspective, the 1918 flu did not end civilization as we know it but it was the second-deadliest event of the last 200 years. Expect people you know to die.

However, there is one critical difference between COVID-19 and the 1918 flu - the 1918 flu virus hit children and young adults particularly hard. COVID-19 seems to be most severe in older adults. Children and young adults generally have mild infections. We are grateful for this.

What can we expect?

This is not the zombie apocalypse. Core infrastructure (e.g., power, water, supermarkets, internet, government, etc.) will continue to work, perhaps with some minor disruptions. 

There will be significant economic disruption: a global recession is very possible and there will probably be significant shortages of some products. The healthcare system will be hit the hardest. The number of people who are likely to get sick is higher than our healthcare systems can probably handle.  

Daily life will be impacted in important ways. Travel is likely to be limited and public gatherings will probably be canceled. Schools will probably be closed. Expect health departments to start issuing these orders in the near future, especially on the West Coast.

The acute pandemic will probably last at least for several months and quite possibly for a year or two.

What can we do?

We can’t keep COVID-19 from being a global pandemic but the more we can do to slow the spread of the disease, the less severe the impact will be. With that in mind, here are the things you can do:

Stay calm but take it seriously. This will likely be bad but it’s not the apocalypse.

Stay home if you’re sick or someone in your house is sick. 

Leave medical supplies for healthcare workers. You shouldn’t be stockpiling masks or other medical supplies. They are needed in hospitals to keep our healthcare workers healthy.

Wash your hands. Get in the habit of frequently washing your hands thoroughly and covering your cough.

Minimize your exposure. Now that we’re starting to see community transmission in the U.S., it’s probably time to start cutting back on your exposure to other people. Depending on your circumstances, consider:

Canceling non-essential travel

Avoiding large-scale gatherings

Working from home if possible

Minimizing direct contact with others including hand shakes and hugs

Reducing your trips out of the house. If possible, shop for two weeks of groceries at once or consider having your groceries delivered. Stay home and cook instead of going to a restaurant.

Remember, keep calm and prepare. This is likely to be bad but if we respond calmly and thoughtfully we can handle it.

97,Not the kind of prep you want to do.,"This post is going to get a little dark. It's about what happens if we fail. It's about death, so if you're already too stressed and don't want to read this, I understand.

Been thinking seriously about the worst case, and that's really what prepping is about, right? Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.

I lost a parent rather suddenly a few years back, not in times of crisis economically or socially, and it was a huge mess. Psychologically, of course, but also legally and financially. I cannot imagine what death will look like if this gets that bad. I haven't even really seen how its being handled in China, nor am I familiar enough with what standard funeral and mourning looks like there.

But, if you can, consider having this talk. Especially if you have elderly relatives. Again, hope for the best, do your absolute best to get them through this safely, but prepping means thinking about the worst case.

And know I'm partially making this post to psych myself up to try to broach this subject with my family.

Having a will and living will in place will save you/your loved ones immense emotional and legal stress. Making sure someone has a copy of any life insurance papers, and benefits from work, any financial obligations, property deeds, inheritance documents. Discuss who will handle costs and arranging things, all that really really unpleasant to think about stuff.

In the US, this also means considering what costs may be incurred during treatment, regardless of outcome, which is a separate category entirely (seriously, it terrifies me). But its still a thing to plan for and discuss. And even if you live somewhere with free healthcare, funerals are still pricy.

I don't know if we can realistically prepare for what the logistics of burial and mourning are going to be during a pandemic, but if your faith and tradition on this are important, and you find clergy willing to listen, maybe talk to them? There's gotta be some who are bracing for this.

If you are or have dependants, that's an entirely different and probably even scary category but all the more vital to put into place. 

And if you know of any guides or tips for having this discussion, honestly, I'm all ears. My mother isn't taking this very seriously and I have no idea how to get her to do this with me.

118,Lesson Learned: Don't guess how long your food will last by eyesight alone.,"My husband and I had a conversation the other day about how long we thought our food would last. I will spare you the embarrassing details of our guesses but we both over estimated and I imagine many people do the same thing. Here's the thing, your eye sight will be optimistic and it WILL fool you. You need to know how many calories you have in your stock pile. We underestimate how poorly nutritioned our modern, boxed and bagged foods are.

I highly recommend you calculate how many calories are in your stockpile today. 

For us, everything was in a tight crawl space and I am pregnant. The last thing I wanted to do was crouch in there and fill out a spreadsheet but I am so glad that I did. This is what I got from the hour I spent:

* We know exactly how long our food will last for full caloric requirements for our family
* We know which foods we need to eat first
* I know which foods I need to buy more of and which I can/should skip because they aren't calorically favorable

**A fellow user,** u/Al_Eltz**, posted a spreadsheet template that you need to fill out and do today.** You can find his original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PandemicPreps/comments/fbvj4q/put\_together\_a\_spreadsheet\_for\_our\_food\_stores/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PandemicPreps/comments/fbvj4q/put_together_a_spreadsheet_for_our_food_stores/).

123,IRL secrecy about prepping is important AND basic opsec,"Just saw a post here by a another pepper - he had a friend say that friend would show up at his house if it goes to shit. Congrats you just added an additional box of ammo to your supplies. 

I'd wouldn't share news or tips irl with anyone you know and aren't prepared to share your supplies with - and not if they can't keep their mouth shut. Make sure your kids and parents also say nothing. 

Remember, peppers are always wrong until we are right. 

Simple reason is that telling people you have prepped makes you a target, or your loose lipped friends make you a target. If you have a wall of respirators when they are sold out/unavailable, that makes you a target. Last thing you want is possibly sick or violent random come looking for you and your family. 

If you want to help people around you, do it after the alarm has gone out and forward information under the ""Someone forwarded it to me"". Or just give them what you've prepped for them after the panic saying ""I picked this up for you after the call went out"". 

If you wanted to do it earlier, do it pretending to be a n00b. Use excuses like ""one of the senior guys at work sent this to me, he thinks it might be serious""

I'd go so far as to say don't tell people what you have - if you want to here, use a throwaway. 

It will probably not get that bad that people will loot and resort to violence, but why risk it.

125,Masterclass - Great way to be productive with your lock-down time,"Rather than binge watch 10 seasons of ""Friends"", you should pick up a 1 year subscription to Masterclass. 

A Masterclass course typically contains 25 video lessons, each of which is five-to-ten minutes long. So they run from 2 to 5 hours each. A Masterclass costs €70 or $90 and comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee for unhappy students.

If you’re taking more than one Masterclass, I recommend buying the All-Access Pass for €150 or $180 per year. The teachers and subject matter are amazing.

127,Getting infected in the Hospital - Left for Dead-Gaslight 3 - Narcan related to Takotsubo Post-Op Explanation,"A true story of mother and daughter experiencing a medical trauma that took us on a wild ride through the hospital system in 2019.

Waiting to be discharged and in a heartbeat, we were faced with

""Takotsubo""

""Stress Cardiomyopathy

 ""Broken Heart Syndrome""

 to signify a few names for her diagnosis.

 My mother went in for outpatient shoulder surgery in September of 2019, and 27 days later we were still under hospital care and

struggling for life.

I made sure to document my time with my mother as it transpired because right away I knew something was different from other hospital visits with my parents. It was during the time we spent in the trenches together in the hospital fighting for her life that I realized we were alone and I would not leave her side or she would pass in the night.

We made it, and now that my mother is home working to recover from the devastating turn of events, I, still being with her as her caretaker, decided this medical case was noteworthy. I have the time since I am currently caring for my parents at our family home in Texas, and having the thought process to write it all out takes time because I didn't want to be presumptive so I have had to read and compare my notes to the [**medical records**](https://www.paigepotpie.com/medical-records) that were provided to me after three attempts to gain access. I was there every second and I remember significant moments because not only did I nearly lose a parent in front of my eyes but because of that I was mentally traumatized by this treatment and how to process it.

It is resounding loudly in my mind still today and refuses to be quieted so I will do what I always do when I am in that position in life. I will write about it. 

 I am here to document my experience with my mother and share an ardent story that I will continue to tell as long as it continues to affect my family and as of today, we have survived and continue to thrive with the love we have for family and duty to the ones you love the most. I am Paige Keaton and this is my story.",PandemicPreps,1583213229,Pek43,1,1,True,2020-03-02 21:27:09,true story mother daughter experiencing medical trauma took us wild ride hospital system discharged heartbeat faced cardiomyopathy broken heart syndrome signify names diagnosis mother went outpatient shoulder surgery september days later still hospital care life made sure document time mother transpired right away knew something different hospital visits parents time spent trenches together hospital fighting life realized alone would leave side would pass night made mother home working recover devastating turn events still caretaker decided medical case noteworthy time since currently caring parents family home texas thought process write takes time want presumptive read compare notes medical records provided three attempts gain access every second remember significant moments nearly lose parent front eyes mentally traumatized treatment process resounding loudly mind still today refuses quieted always position life write document experience mother share ardent story continue tell long continues affect family today survived continue thrive love family duty ones love paige keaton story,true stori mother daughter experienc medic trauma took us wild ride hospit system discharg heartbeat face cardiomyopathi broken heart syndrom signifi name diagnosi mother went outpati shoulder surgeri septemb day later still hospit care life made sure document time mother transpir right away knew someth differ hospit visit parent time spent trench togeth hospit fight life realiz alon would leav side would pass night made mother home work recov devast turn event still caretak decid medic case noteworthi time sinc current care parent famili home texa thought process write take time want presumpt read compar note medic record provid three attempt gain access everi second rememb signific moment nearli lose parent front eye mental traumat treatment process resound loudli mind still today refus quiet alway posit life write document experi mother share ardent stori continu tell long continu affect famili today surviv continu thrive love famili duti one love paig keaton stori

130,Frustrated with my roommate. It seems like there’s a high chance the virus will make its way to my community,"My roommate and I don’t really talk. It’s not hostile; we just have nothing in common. I’ve noticed that he hasn’t made any additional effort to prep. I feel awkward bringing it up because no one else in my town is concerned. Most people here just think it’s a joke.

I’ve purchased cleaning supplies as well as some food that I think will last me two weeks. That is, if I don’t have to share. His pantry, on the other hand, is empty and he’s made no additional effort to clean our living space. 

Now the real kicker is that he and everyone else in my program (besides me) are flying to San Antonio, Texas this week for the AWP conference. The same area that now has an outbreak. It appears the conference will not be cancelled. 12,000 people will be pouring into that area, including my roommate and classmates. Additionally, my school has cancelled its study abroad programs and the students in Italy will be returning to campus.

144,Update on Hubby not being n board,"I guess my little outburst which I did apologize to him for a struck a nerve because last night on his way home from work he sent me a text asking me if there was anything I needed from Costco that would make me feel more comfortable with what we have prepared. Shock the hell out of me. So I sent him just a small list of an extra pack of toilet paper, an extra case of water, and some canned chicken or tuna. 3 things. Figured I start small. 

He came home with that plus a first aid kit (i didn’t have the heart to tell him i already have 2), alcohol, cleaners, vitamins,  a bag of Easter candy (which is bizarre for him), detergent, pasta and sauce And some protein bars.  

He said i wanted to get bleach but there was none. (I reminded him that I had bought two cases of that previously it’s in the laundry room) 

Something spooked him. What I don’t know. Either he just wants me happy or he really is beginning to realize this is could be an issue.

158,Storage of items,"I've seen some awesome preps, awesome storage and so on. I have seen a few things that I would like to comment on.  I used to work in food service at a school cafeteria so I have a few tips.

Please make sure that you have something underneath the bottom of any of your food stores that are on the floor. Could be a wood pallet, or a small plastic riser. These will help with air flow around your storage areas. Plus you do not want to store anything directly on concrete. It only needs to be a few inches, you really don't want yucky stuff leaching into your food or water, and spills are very difficult to clean. At least if something did spill it will go all the way to the floor/concrete and your preps won't be sitting in it until you notice/find it. 

Store items that may leak on the lowest levels possible. Bottled water should be at the absolute bottom and should be stored upright to prevent leakage. Bottles will leak, I've had it happen to me before. You absolutely do not want to have your bottled water leaking on your dry rice and beans. 

Place items where if they were to leak or bust they wouldn't ruin other foods by running down onto dry goods. So place boxed and dry goods above canned goods. You can wipe other cans off it one were to bust, you may have a much bigger problem if a can were to leak onto a bag of pasta. 

I would likely store cleaning supplies away from any food, as in the bathroom or under your kitchen sinks. Or even in the laundry room. You really don't want Lysol knocked over onto your food. Also make sure you have bottles properly labeled with what is inside of it. If you are mixing chemicals with water for sanitizers and cleaners, please write BOLDLY on the outside of the bottle what is inside and what the % mixture is. 

You should also think about these things in regards to your refrigerators. Meats should be stored to thaw on the lowest rack possible with a lipped pan under it to catch any leaks from the packaging. 

I know a lot of this seems like common sense, but we can forget these things as we are trying to fit that last can into the last bit of space we have.",PandemicPreps,1583268151,cherryblossoms2018,11,1,True,2020-03-03 12:42:31,seen awesome preps awesome storage seen things would like comment used work food service school cafeteria tips make sure something underneath bottom food stores floor could wood pallet small plastic riser help air flow around storage areas plus want store anything directly concrete needs inches really want yucky stuff leaching food water spills difficult clean least something spill go way floor concrete preps sitting notice find items may leak lowest levels possible bottled water absolute bottom stored upright prevent leakage bottles leak happen absolutely want bottled water leaking dry rice beans items leak bust ruin foods running onto dry goods place boxed dry goods canned goods wipe cans one bust may much bigger problem leak onto bag pasta would likely store cleaning supplies away food bathroom kitchen sinks even laundry room really want lysol knocked onto food also make sure bottles properly labeled inside mixing chemicals water sanitizers cleaners please write boldly outside bottle inside mixture also think things regards refrigerators meats stored thaw lowest rack possible lipped pan catch leaks packaging know lot seems like common sense forget things trying fit last last bit space,seen awesom prep awesom storag seen thing would like comment use work food servic school cafeteria tip make sure someth underneath bottom food store floor could wood pallet small plastic riser help air flow around storag area plu want store anyth directli concret need inch realli want yucki stuff leach food water spill difficult clean least someth spill go way floor concret prep sit notic find item may leak lowest level possibl bottl water absolut bottom store upright prevent leakag bottl leak happen absolut want bottl water leak dri rice bean item leak bust ruin food run onto dri good place box dri good can good wipe can one bust may much bigger problem leak onto bag pasta would like store clean suppli away food bathroom kitchen sink even laundri room realli want lysol knock onto food also make sure bottl properli label insid mix chemic water sanit cleaner pleas write boldli outsid bottl insid mixtur also think thing regard refriger meat store thaw lowest rack possibl lip pan catch leak packag know lot seem like common sens forget thing tri fit last last bit space
159,How are governments so unprepared for the extra need of masks and other such products?,"I keep hearing that people shouldn't be buying masks and shouldn't be wearing masks. And I keep hearing that it's more important for those who are sick and for health care workers to have to access to masks (which isn't necessarily wrong), and I keep hearing about how many masks the government is buying up from retailers and contracting the production of from suppliers.

So why are they even in this sudden shortage anyway? Wouldn't you assume that governments would already have stockpiles of these types of things just for a situation like this? So that they can more promptly and safely address a sudden deadly breakout (of whatever virus or illness it may be at any point in time)?

Is this something that the government just doesn't do? Or did they severely underestimate things?

And why in the world are we constantly being told not to wear masks? If you wear a mask, wash your hands, refrain from touching your face, and are careful about being exposed, aren't those all good ways to reduce risk of infection? So why are we being told constantly that masks will doing absolutely nothing?

We know that wearing masks when sick or when possibly in contact with sick people can reduce our chances of getting sick. They do this in hospitals all the time for patients with infections. So why is only just now that masks suddenly won't do anything? Doesn't it stand to reason that if I'm visiting a family member in the hospital, and I've been told I have to mask and glove up to see them because they have an infection, that the same procedures would help me from getting sick while out in public where I have no idea who may actually be sick because the country is barely testing anyone to begin with?",PandemicPreps,1583270461,novantigone,21,1,True,2020-03-03 13:21:01,keep hearing people buying masks wearing masks keep hearing important sick health care workers access masks necessarily wrong keep hearing many masks government buying retailers contracting production suppliers even sudden shortage anyway assume governments would already stockpiles types things situation like promptly safely address sudden deadly breakout whatever virus illness may point time something government severely underestimate things world constantly told wear masks wear mask wash hands refrain touching face careful exposed good ways reduce risk infection told constantly masks absolutely nothing know wearing masks sick possibly contact sick people reduce chances getting sick hospitals time patients infections masks suddenly anything stand reason visiting family member hospital told mask glove see infection procedures would help getting sick public idea may actually sick country barely testing anyone begin,keep hear peopl buy mask wear mask keep hear import sick health care worker access mask necessarili wrong keep hear mani mask govern buy retail contract product supplier even sudden shortag anyway assum govern would alreadi stockpil type thing situat like promptli safe address sudden deadli breakout whatev viru ill may point time someth govern sever underestim thing world constantli told wear mask wear mask wash hand refrain touch face care expos good way reduc risk infect told constantli mask absolut noth know wear mask sick possibl contact sick peopl reduc chanc get sick hospit time patient infect mask suddenli anyth stand reason visit famili member hospit told mask glove see infect procedur would help get sick public idea may actual sick countri bare test anyon begin

168,I invested in a rice cooker and popcorn machine,"Today I decided it was the right choice to purchase needed cooking equipment since since Jan prepping I invested about $900 in all the food, seasonings &amp; oils, medicines, water, cleaning supplies, and emergency/first aid equipment. 

This came to realization when I thought about what it would be like cooking and how convenient I could make it. I already have 2 crock pots but crock pots are not good for rice because rice needs higher temperatures. If I cook stove top it would take a long time plus I'd end up paying a higher gas bill. So I looked at Best Buy and found a $20 rice cooker with good reviews and it was simple but did its purpose. 

The popcorn maker was also from Best Buy at a cheap $14 that plugs in and simple to use.

178,Airborne infection vs Hands &amp; Mouth,"I've been washing and sanitizing my hands religiously the last week or so, hoping not to pick up the flu or corona virus as I touch my face a lot, bite my nails, etc.   


I recently discovered that the CDC is stating that infection from physical contact is not the primary method of infection, but but airborne transfer is.  This came as news to me, but seems obvious now that I think about it. What also surprised me is that they say being within 6 feet of a person who is infected is the primary means of infection, with coughing and sneezing adding even more severity. 

&amp;#x200B;

This was all news to me, so I figured I would share with the rest of the people who may not have been informed. I've been washing my hands a lot after shopping at the store, but I've stood in lines right next to plenty of people. So be careful when out and about gathering your supplies.

[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/transmission.html)

### Person-to-person spread

The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.

* Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
* Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.

### Spread from contact with infected surfaces or objects

It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.",PandemicPreps,1583296347,welcometotheregime,4,1,True,2020-03-03 20:32:27,washing sanitizing hands religiously last week hoping pick flu corona virus touch face lot bite nails etc recently discovered cdc stating infection physical contact primary method infection airborne transfer came news seems obvious think also surprised say within feet person infected primary means infection coughing sneezing adding even severity news figured would share rest people may informed washing hands lot shopping store stood lines right next plenty people careful gathering supplies person person spread virus thought spread mainly person person people close contact one another within feet respiratory droplets produced infected person coughs sneezes droplets land mouths noses people nearby possibly inhaled lungs spread contact infected surfaces objects may possible person get covid touching surface object virus touching mouth nose possibly eyes thought main way virus spreads,wash sanit hand religi last week hope pick flu corona viru touch face lot bite nail etc recent discov cdc state infect physic contact primari method infect airborn transfer came news seem obviou think also surpris say within feet person infect primari mean infect cough sneez ad even sever news figur would share rest peopl may inform wash hand lot shop store stood line right next plenti peopl care gather suppli person person spread viru thought spread mainli person person peopl close contact one anoth within feet respiratori droplet produc infect person cough sneez droplet land mouth nose peopl nearbi possibl inhal lung spread contact infect surfac object may possibl person get covid touch surfac object viru touch mouth nose possibl eye thought main way viru spread
179,List of meds/vitamins for preparation and survival,"So I am by no means any medical expert but I am creating a list of what I found to help from my research, if anyone has anyone wants to contribute or suggest edits you are welcome to.

Prevention of sickness:
Elderberry - try to get 250-1000mg daily
Zinc - 15-50mg daily (copper is important at higher doses as zinc depletes that)
Vitamin c - 1000mg
 
While sick:
Guafenesin (expectorant) - this will break up mucus and allow you to cough it up easier clearing airways.
Ibuprofen - help manage fevers and inflammation / pain
Tulsi / holy basil tea(also good for prevention) - a well known Indian herb for colds and helping with respiratory ailments. 
Albuterol / inhaler - good for temporarily opening airways
Oxygen / oxygen concentrator - if your o2 falls too low and you can't get help at a hospital because it is over run you may need this.

Avoid:
Cough suppresents. They will not allow you to clear your airways. Most flu medicines have them so I would stay away.
benzodiazepines - while good for temporarily realivng anxiety, they can comprise your immune system.
Proton pump inhibitors (ppi) - given to people with gerd but reduces b12 and zinc levels needed for immune system
Alcohol - good for after the plague but not during. It will comprise you immune response.

Misc.
A pulse ox. It's not meds but will let you monitor your o2 and if it falls under 85-90 you need to go to the Dr probably. I just got this one:
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BLJTQTZ/ref=cm_sw_r_em_apa_i_v0YxEbZX1D3YS
Humidifier - helpful for clearing airways
Fluids - not everyone can get an IV so make sure to drink a lot. Tea is easier sometimes and Gatorade has much needed carbs and electrolytes.

187,Salbutamol + Building a Clean Air Shelter,"Something I haven't seen on a lot of ""essential medication"" prepping lists is a salbutamol (""Ventolin""/""Asmol"" in Australia) inhaler/puffer. They are available over the counter in Australian pharmacies and retail for roughly $6.50.

Today I got one from my chemist for free because they still had some left over from their bushfire emergency allocation. 

In times of emergency this fast acting inhaler can do a lot of good. With the recent bushfires I have seen an INCREDIBLE amount of people at our clinic affected by the bushfire smoke, most of them young, fit, healthy, and with no pre existing lung or breathing issues. 

Bushfires aside, chemical smoke/fumes - heck even fumes from new cleaning agents you are suddenly furiously scrubbing your house down with - can and will overwhelm and irritate otherwise healthy people's lungs (sometimes irreparably).

So, tip 1 #WHEN USING CLEANING AGENTS  KEEP ALL AREAS WELL VENTILATED and USE RECOMMENDED PPE
You don't want to have done all this work ready to isolate and now have to rock up to Emergency because you are having trouble breathing.

#2 Salbutamol can only do so much
Seek emergency aid if the person is not recovering after administration. If recovered quickly, when it is safe to do so, STILL SEEK medical advice and talk to a professional about the incident. You may have inadvertently exposed a pre-existing condition that needs further investigation.

192,Has anyone performed cleaning/disinfectant drills at home?,"Last night when my wife was at Target Children medicine aisle, some asshole coughed heavily directly behind her. She moved away immediately and the guy took her place and was casually browsing whatever stock was remaining on the shelves.

Sounded more like he was clearing the area for himself. But out of caution, I had her come home immediately, throw the clothes in the washer and take a shower. She had to walk through our living room to get to our Master bath and washer on the 2nd floor.

Example:  Clorox wipes say to use enough wipes to leave the surface wet for 2 minutes before wiping dry.  That can be several wipes for one surface. I used 4 on my work desk &amp; that was enough.

199,Is a generator high on your list? What sort?,"We live in suburbia of a smaller city. We get outages maybe 3 or 4 times a year that typically last several hours at most. I'm not particularly worried about extended outage and SHTF, but a little worried about an outage that will go on just long enough to spoil everything in our freezers due to crews maybe being a little shorthanded. We have shelf stable goods, propane stove, etc., but there's the potential to lose a lot of food and it was my goal to not have to go grocery shopping for a few months.

I've been prepping since January and brushed off the need for a generator since Wuhan seems to have kept power on, but now I'm questioning myself. 

I tossed around getting a standby installed (we have natural gas), but would need things like inspection and permits I'm not keen on doing right now. I don't mind spending on a generator, but am unsure of what to buy to power a full size freezer and refrigerator for a few days. We could get by for the outage without anything else powered. My husband is super busy (healthcare - I know, I might as well accept we're both getting it), but fairly handy with electric items, but I'd like to make the least amount of work for him.

I’m wondering if a liquid to store toothbrushes might reduce sharing germs in my own house- but I can’t find anything online.  I’m thinking maybe mouthwash with a touch of bleach?

202,How to sanitze your clothes and groceries? How to wash your hair?,"Maybe I am posting this in the wrong subreddit but I'm an idiot procrastinator who didn't start worrying until it was too late. So I will be going out to buy groceries and supplies in a time when it's likely there are a lot of people around me who are sick but didn't get tested or show no symptoms yet. I read that the virus can survive for 9 days on surfaces so if I started at the right time I would have just let everything I buy sit for 9 days before use but now I don't have this option.

So I am wondering what's the best way to clean groceries in a thorough but reasonable way. What solutions are confirmed to work and how long do they have to be applied? Are there any alternatives if I won't be able to find any of the disinfectants in stock? I've seen stores sell disinfectants with 45% ethanol which I heard is not enough. 

Next I wonder if just using normal detergent is enough or does it have to have specific ingredients. What about the temperature?

Lastly I realized that when washing your hair the water can get into your eyes and nose which is a pathway for the infection. What do you do about that? Should you shave your head? Wear goggles?

205,I’m losing my hope - please share your views x,"Prepping done. Kids at home - home schooling for time being. Trying to avoid going out as much as possible. Still waiting for some stuff in post (I know I know it carries a risk) but really gearing up to a full quarantine. But...I already have had enough. I’m already missing my “normal” life. And nothing has started yet...
It just downed at me that this shit can take a very looooong time. It’s not like most ppl think (or assume) that it will be 2-4 weeks...we’re facing major change, which will impact our lives for a long time. Potentially of course.
Where I live there is only one case confirmed. To date and shall I say officially? God knows what is happening regarding H2H community spread and we will not know until there is a cluster confirmed, and that’s too late for me. Normies are getting on with their lives without any sense of danger. Guess, that’s their perogative.

Anyway, I can’t stop thinking, more and more, what is the point? All prepping done.we should be fine for up to 3 months. However, realistically a quarantine might need to last much longer. We’re prob 4-6 weeks b4 SHTF...then you have another 6-8 weeks (at the very min) for a virus to hit a top of the bell curve.
Say three months. What then? There won’t be any cure for at least another 18 months or so. What do we do after three months? It might still be dangerous to go out. God knows how economy will hold up. It’s just one big unknown. What can we expect? What do we really need to prepare for?

208,Prepping Activities to Keep Your Kids Busy During a Quarantine,"Hi! Former preschool teacher and current anxious prepper here. I wanted to share a few ideas for those who have young kids that will inevitably be climbing the walls during a preventative quarantine. Most of these items can be purchased at the dollar store so you’re not breaking the bank or wasting money that could have been allocated for food. I recommend purchasing easy things like bubbles, sidewalk chalk, craft supplies, and floaty bath toys. Here’s a few easy ideas for some fun sensory activities. 

First I’d suggest picking up a few small wash bins, some measuring cups, funnels, and measuring spoons for sensory activities. Bonus points for a tarp to put under to contain the mess/aid in clean up. 

**Baby shampoo and food coloring**- you can fill small bins with the baby shampoo and let your kids experiment with adding drops of different colors. You can also put some of the shampoo and a few tbsp of water into a kitchenaid or use an electric hand mixer to turn the shampoo into foam. You can also give your kids one of those old school crank hand mixers for them to foam up the soap. Kids love to give their dolls baths, make a car wash for their hot wheels, or really any other waterproof toy can be added in to the mix. Using baby shampoo is key because it won’t sting their eyes if they touch their faces. 

**Cornstarch**- you can mix corn starch with water to create a non-Newtonian substance known as Ooblek. You can also do cornstarch+hair conditioner (cloud dough) cornstarch+cake frosting (play dough like consistency), and cornstarch+dish soap+water+blender(will make sea foam), cornstarch+glue+baking soda(makes slime). You can search on Pinterest for any of the things I’ve put in parentheses for recipes and exact measurements. 

**Bath Bombs**-the dollar store has tons of fun bath bombs. They have packs of 3 for $1 as well as larger individual bath bombs. My kids LOVE dropping them in bins of water with their dinosaurs or farm animal toys. 

**Rice**-once you have enough in your regular stash you can dye rice all the colors of the rainbow (food coloring+a bit of vinegar) and let your kids scoop, pour, and fill to their hearts content. Finish off that first jar of peanut butter from your stash? Great! Wash it out, peel off the label and throw it to your kids to play with in their rainbow rice. Endless hours of fun! 

**Pasta**-similarly to the rice project described above you can dye pasta for tons of fun. You can use any shape of pasta, we especially like penne and the mini star pasta (I’ve only found the star pasta at target but it’s also only $1/bag) A fun variation is to cook spaghetti, add a bit of oil so it doesn’t stick together, and then dye it with food coloring. My kids love playing with it and especially love using their little kid scissors to cut it up. 

**Playdough**-Sure you could buy some, but even more fun is making it. You’ll need flour, salt, veg oil, and cream of tartar. We like to add extracts like lemon, orange, or almond to make it smell good (you can also use those essential oils you bought to rub on your b-hole to try to cure the virus) Check Pinterest for playdough recipes. 

**Clean Mud**- toilet paper and grated soap mixed with a bit of water. Pinterest it. 

**Shaving Cream**-not much more to it than that. Spray some in a bin or a baking sheet and kids can drop diluted food coloring into it, mix it around, plow their toy animals through it, write letters with their fingers in it. 

**Baking Soda and Vinegar ** sure you could do your standard volcano experiment with it, tons of fun. You can also do what my kids love do which is covering a baking sheet or cake pan with baking soda and use an eye dropper or pipette to drop dyed vinegar onto it. It takes a long time to make their way through dropping the vinegar onto the tray and is a fun experiment in color mixing. 

**Moon Sand**- mix flour and baby oil to make a really cool textured substance known as moon sand. It’s about 8 cups flour to 1 cup baby oil. Your kids will also smell really nice after playing with it. 

**DIY Lava Lamps**- you’ll need oil, water, food coloring, and alka seltzer tabs. Fill a clear jar half way with oil, half way with colored water and drop in an alka seltzer tab.",PandemicPreps,1583363110,Prepping4Corona,21,2,True,2020-03-04 15:05:10,hi former preschool teacher

209,FYI you don’t need a Costco membership if ordering through Instacart,"Pretty much as the title states. Have been following this sub since the beginning but haven’t seen it mentioned here so I thought I’d share. 

You don’t need a Costco membership to shop there through Instacart.

210,REMEMBER TO SPLIT YOUR SUPPLIES,"In the last days I've seen lots of your pictures of shelves, sideboards and furnitures full of food and cleaning supplies. You did a good job, but most of you forgot a basic rule for a prepper: **split the supplies** and put them away in several places.

This is crucial because:

* to whoever is concerned of a possible increase of home invasions related to a disruption of supplies, you don't want the thieves to easily find (and take away) your entire supply of face masks/disinfectant/gloves/food
* if a mouse/rat enters your house, you need to minimize the chances he will contaminate your food or destroy your protective gear
* if your neighbor will come to ask food or protective gear, or you'll have friends for dinner, you don't want 'em to see all your supplies. Be a grey man and hide your stuff because envy is bad and will be amplified during a catastrophic event
* If you have children or pets...you know they destroy things
* in case of an accident (flooded basement - small fire) you don't want to lose all your supplies

&amp;#x200B;

So basically you need to **minimize the risks of losing your stuff** if an accident will occur. As per the current situation, your most precious items are face masks, goggles, gloves, soap, chlorine and food. You can split the supplies and put them in different boxes around the house (garage, attic, basement, your car).

i live in central texas, about three hours in from the coast.  we were in NO DANGER of the hurricane, by any stretch of the imagination.   and i'm telling you...people lost their got danged minds when it was getting close to hitting the coast.  the grocery stores were emptied of water in a matter of hours.  all the bread, all the rice, all the fruit, all the beans were just cleared off the shelves.  we had no gasoline.  it was absolute insanity, and i cannot repeat this enough, we were in absolutely zero danger of physical harm or property damage.  people just freaked out.  


i can't even begin to imagine what's going to happen as this situation unfolds and gets closer to home.  it isn't going to be pretty.    


so i took stock of what i had, made a list of what i needed, and started to build my cache.  my plan is to keep adding to it each payday until i feel i have enough.  right now i could probably live comfortably confined to my home for a few weeks, but i think for my own peace of mind i'll try to at least double what i have.  i credit this community for helping me to focus my thinking and take action.",PandemicPreps,1583368960,DespicableFibers,24,1,True,2020-03-04 16:42:40,watching reading increasing dread sure ultimately made decide prep memory hurricane harvey live central texas three hours coast danger hurricane stretch imagination telling people lost got danged minds getting close hitting coast grocery stores emptied water matter hours bread rice fruit beans cleared shelves gasoline absolute insanity cannot repeat enough absolutely zero danger physical harm property damage people freaked even begin imagine going happen situation unfolds gets closer home going pretty took stock made list needed started build cache plan keep adding payday feel enough right could probably live comfortably confined home weeks think peace mind try least double credit community helping focus thinking take action,watch read increas dread sure ultim made decid prep memori hurrican harvey live central texa three hour coast danger hurrican stretch imagin tell peopl lost got dang mind get close hit coast groceri store empti water matter hour bread rice fruit bean clear shelv gasolin absolut insan cannot repeat enough absolut zero danger physic harm properti damag peopl freak even begin imagin go happen situat unfold get closer home go pretti took stock made list need start build cach plan keep ad payday feel enough right could probabl live comfort confin home week think peac mind tri least doubl credit commun help focu think take action

221,Special Dietary Needs Prepping,"Is anyone else prepping with special dietary needs (or any other needs- doesn’t just have to be dietary)? I have celiac so I am prepping gluten free, and I have also been a vegetarian for most of my life. I’d eat meat in a pinch if it was all that was available, but I get sick if I eat gluten (wheat, barley, or rye). 

Prepping all gluten free stuff has been a little frustrating. Many things that people can prep easily- flour, beans, etc. have gluten or could have gluten. I tried to get some lentils yesterday- it had the lovely “may contain wheat” statement on the back. It’s also not cheap, but I accepted that long ago. Gluten free things, especially stuff that’s shelf stable, can be much more expensive than the “regular” products!!

Being gluten free has also encouraged me to prep- if there is little food selection due to shortages, I want to make sure I have food that’s safe to eat! It’s made me feel a lot calmer being able to ensure I have several weeks of food stocked to make sure I can eat healthy meals that are safe.

225,This is the first question I ask people when they say things aren’t that bad...,"“Can you tell me how many people, worldwide, are infected with this virus?” 

I get a pretty good pause and a nervous laugh, usually. 

“Well, no...” 

Whatever the number is that day I give it to them and their eyes twitch a bit and there’s some awkward shuffling. They aren’t paying attention to the facts, just the outer shell of what this. “The common flu, a cold”. I know this because the surprise trickles down their face and they go right back to that ‘tone’ in their voice. 

“Well, we don’t really know how bad it actually is—“ or something near that but I see something click. Maybe in the back of their head they realize something. 

As we near 100,000 cases with no sign of slowing I feel scared for my friends and family who insist it’s just the flu. Sometimes I wish I could trick myself into thinking this was no big deal but the reality is this is serious. 

If people would address this for what it is we would stop seeing stories of people being denied testing, unnecessary spread. But the fact of the matter is there’s an obtuse thought pattern of denying this for as long as possible and it’s just causing more damage. 

Proactive vs reactive. 

I saw someone post something yesterday about how we are going to hear this a lot when everything is over. 

“We never knew it could get like this, or that is was actually that bad—wah wah wah.” 

The evidence was here all along it’s just some of us don’t want to see it. 

Keep. Preparing. 

Don’t panic like these people and shut down. Whatever you are working towards to solidify your safety in the future just keep on going. Do it quietly. And if you feel defeated by close family just nod and smile and keep putting toilet paper and water in your cart as you do 🤪🤣.

I’ve just started noticing ppl stocking up here, particularly water, paper towels, toilet paper, pasta, rice, beans, steel cut oats. The bulk rice &amp; beans were gone at my Wal-Mart yesterday. I had to wait in a short line of ppl waiting to disinfect their cart. Usually everyone just skips past that station. There were shopping carts strewn all over the parking lot. I counted about a dozen just walking from my car to the door. Idk what the other half of the lot looked like. 

Nobody is taking this seriously &amp; it’s really getting to me. I spoke to a friend yesterday &amp; she said that this virus is less concerning than the flu! She even has family overseas that is quarantined in their home! I fear for my older parents, my unhealthy friends, my medical-worker friends, my family, my community. What else can I do besides encourage others to prepare? I cannot financially prepare for everyone in my family that isn’t taking this seriously while they have a chance now.

247,"After suffering from a week long flu-like illness, these are the things I overlooked in my preps","I've been suffering from some sort of flu-like illness, since Sunday. The symptoms are remarkably similar to coronavirus: fever, dry cough, body aches, chills, fatigue, etc. I went to the doctor on Monday, and my flu test was negative, but at the time, I didn't meet the criteria for coronavirus testing in the US, so I've been home ever since. (Honestly, it's fine. I'd prefer to stay here, even if I have it, as long as I don't need medical attention, and just nurse myself back to health at home.) 

Luckily, I was almost done with my preps before this hit me, but I was surprised to find that there were a few things I overlooked. 

* Cough Suppressant (dextromethorphan) -  I know you're not supposed to suppress a productive cough, but mine is not. It's just annoying. I only had DayQuil on hand (which contains dextromethorphan), but I wasn't interested in a drug cocktail. I just wanted the dextromethorphan.
* Cough drops - Even with the dextromethorphan, I get in coughing fits, and a cough drop really helps to quiet them down.
* Something to help you sleep - melatonin, NyQuil, Benadryl, etc. The coughing has really kept me up, and I wished I had Melatonin on hand to help me get some rest. I did have NyQuil and Benadryl, but prefer to go natural, when possible.
* Chicken noodle soup, and lots of it! I had some of this, but I've eaten almost all of it. It's one of the few things that sounds good, and if you have a family, where many people could get sick at once, you might need a lot of it.
* Easy cook meals for the rest of the family, if the usual chef is sick. Luckily, my husband and kids have kept their distance, and haven't caught whatever I have, but if my husband was sick too, we would have needed easy meals that the kids could cook for themselves: frozen pizza, frozen dinners, etc. 
* Extra sheets and lounge clothing. With the fever, I have sweat through my clothes and sheets, multiple times per day, and not having to do laundry right away, is nice!

The ""best by"" date is often just that, it tastes BEST if you eat it BY a certain date. Food rarely will make you sick if you eat it past its best by date, it just may not taste as good. I also presumed you have repackaged each item into an nice, air tight container. If you're constantly opening and closing the bag, then flavor is going to degrade over time. A quick way to judge how long something will last is by its fat content. Fat goes rancid, so the higher the fat, the quicker it goes bad. Storing it unopened, in a dark, cool place will make your fatty foods last longer. It will make the straight carb/protein foods taste better too.

Don't forget to buy canned vegetables, and soups, and spices to make sure not absolutely sick of your food, too. Salt is like 40 cents for a pound and a half, that is a super cheap prep that also lasts forever. Also, if you're storing flour, don't forget to buy some yeast for to make your bread.

257,"Report from my last major shop for March, at a local warehouse club...","Location:  a state of the US with ZERO confirmed cases, but confirmed cases are creeping closer and closer every day.

We spent quite a lot of time and money prepping, from Jan 23 onwards.  Still, there's always that last $500 or $700 haul...  We keep thinking we're going to be short on meat, dairy, and fat.  Really at this point it's a matter of tastes and preference because we have quite a stock of nuts, beans, etc. for protein but we're just accustomed to eating meat.

So I took a chance and went to our local member's only bulk goods/warehouse club place, for what I hope is the last time this month.  (Actually I hope it's fine and I can go back in a week or two, but my plan is not to return for at least 2 weeks, and longer if our local situation gets worse.)  

I went all-out on meat that we can freeze, grabbed one more pack of t.p., a few 25-lb bags of this and that, etc.  I figured rice and beans was going to get old quick.  


Random observations:

* Dozens of people gave my cart the eye; they knew exactly what I was doing

* People were openly discussing prepping; I heard Asian female asking her non-Asian significant other, ""So you said we need to be ready with water, too, right?"" and 2 minutes later an elderly lady asked her ancient mom, ""I know you said you don't care about all of this, but I just think you ought to stock..."" and the mom interrupted, ""I'm 87 years old and I don't...""

* They sell 3 kinds of rice and 2 kinds were totally sold out.

* My favorite brand of t.p. usually has about 4 to 6 pallets of product available; they were down to the last pallet with only 3 items left on it.

* Asian lady one aisle up from me had a powerfully loaded cart full, nothing but virus supplies (two 48-packs of water, cleaners, trash bags, paper towels, toilet paper)

* At least half a dozen people had a recurring cough; I avoided them but they kept popping up

* On my way in, a pickup truck guy was loading a lawn-mower tractor full of food, and so were two elderly men who had numerous cans of meat, bulk packs of t.p. and paper towels, and shelf-stable food

* On my way out, a Chinese guy and a non-Chinese female were loading a large trailer (the kind that can carry a large motorcycle and accessories) with about 6 carts worth of food.  The dude eyed me and my cart up and down, while I eyed their massive haul up and down, and we both knew.",PandemicPreps,1583451260,TeRiYaki32,28,1,True,2020-03-05 15:34:20,location state us zero confirmed cases confirmed cases creeping closer closer every day spent quite lot time money prepping jan onwards still always last haul keep thinking going short meat dairy fat really point matter tastes preference quite stock nuts beans etc protein accustomed eating meat took chance went local member bulk goods warehouse club place hope last time month actually hope fine go back week two plan return least weeks longer local situation gets worse went meat freeze grabbed one pack p lb bags etc figured rice beans going get old quick observations dozens people gave cart eye knew exactly people openly discussing prepping heard asian female asking non asian significant said need ready water right minutes later elderly lady asked ancient mom know said care think ought stock mom interrupted years old sell kinds rice kinds totally sold favorite brand p usually pallets product available last pallet items left asian lady one aisle powerfully loaded cart full nothing virus supplies two packs water cleaners trash bags paper towels toilet paper least half dozen people recurring cough avoided kept popping way pickup truck guy loading lawn mower tractor full food two elderly men numerous cans meat bulk packs p paper towels shelf stable food way chinese guy non chinese female loading large trailer kind carry large motorcycle accessories carts worth food dude eyed cart eyed massive haul knew,locat state us zero confirm case confirm case creep closer closer everi day spent quit lot time money prep jan onward still alway last haul keep think go short meat dairi fat realli point matter tast prefer quit stock nut bean etc protein accustom eat meat took chanc went local member bulk good warehous club place hope last time month actual hope fine go back week two plan return least week longer local situat get wors went meat freez grab one pack p lb bag etc figur rice bean go get old quick observ dozen peopl gave cart eye knew exactli peopl openli discuss prep heard asian femal ask non asian signific said need readi water right minut later elderli ladi ask ancient mom know said care think ought stock mom interrupt year old sell kind rice kind total sold favorit brand p usual pallet product avail last pallet item left asian ladi one aisl power load cart full noth viru suppli two pack water cleaner trash bag paper towel toilet paper least half dozen peopl recur cough avoid kept pop way pickup truck guy load lawn mower tractor full food two elderli men numer can meat bulk pack p paper towel shelf stabl food way chines guy non chines femal load larg trailer kind carri larg motorcycl accessori cart worth food dude eye cart eye massiv haul knew
258,"Question regarding dried beans, rice, and Mylar bags for storage.","Hello to this amazing community! 

I have learned so much from lurking here, and feel far better prepared due to tips and tricks I have picked up from reading various threads, so thank you! (My fave suggestion, if this is still an option for you, is to get a whole bunch of carrots, celery, onions, and bell peppers, slice ‘em up, and freeze them so your food can have more flavor!)

My dried beans and rice have been in the freezer for a week now, and I’m antsy to get them into long term storage to free up space in the freezers. I have four food safe buckets, but the pricing for the lids went through the roof (I was going to do the dry ice trick, but that isn’t an option due to the lid issue.) So I have buckets, but no lids.

After researching here, I acquired some Mylar bags, and my question is...can I just transfer the beans and rice straight from the freezer into the Mylar bags? Take them out of their plastic packaging, yes? Or just shove the whole thing still in plastic into the Mylar bag?

259,[Question] 3M respirator vapor cartridge useful lifespan?,"I have some 3M 6200 respirators I plan to use with 6001 Organic Vapor cartridges and various n95/p95 filters held in place by a 501.

266,"R95 and N95 respirators are still available, you just have to think outside of Home Depot","Maybe I stocked up two weeks ago. Maybe I didn't.


I know it's unhealthy but I had today off and couldn't help thinking of people who might come over in need. So I did a four hour run.

Home Depot? GTFO. Your mileage may vary, but in my suburban/urban area they are picked clean and have been for a long time. The drywall or lawn and garden section trick doesn't work any more, at least not where I'm from, everyone knows about that.


You know where I had luck? Mom and Pop hardware stores and Paint Supply stores. If you buy a $40 R95 you get the same protection and it looks like a cool as shit Bane mask. Plus the seal is better. And it's 12x as expensive so you can feel like Gwyneth Paltrow: https://www.instagram.com/p/B9BxGPqFfpw/

I had to really dig but I got four N95s too. If you are on the fence about R95s, get one with a return policy because at one store some house painters bought 7 after I got 2, because their business is fucked if they don't have them. And there is no guilt of taking an N95 away from a medical professional, R95s are literally for painting.

The point here is draw outside of the lines, it's the dustier more obscure stores that don't have a Yelp presence that you want to check out. The product will have actual dust on the packaging.

276,100% Truth About The Corona Virus NCOV COVID-19,"**100% Truth About The Corona Virus NCOV COVID-19**

There are too much stupid information about this epidemic event from all entities including the authority, governments, media, individual person, etc. So I have decide to tell you the truth whether you able to deal and cope with the information or not, it is up to you.

**Fact 1:**  
 The corona virus NCOV COVID-19 is much smaller than ant.  
 When a tiny being virus vs a giant being human, there is no need to fear, all you need to do is understand the “trick” of the game and will easily win the battle and overcome that virus.

**Fact 2:**  
 In order to overcome and able to deal with the virus, you must face the truth and you must able to answer just only 3 questions:  
 1. What is the origin of this virus, how it was made?  
 2. Why some nations spread virus much faster than other?  
 3. What are the features, the strength &amp; weakness of this virus?

**Fact 3:**  
 The virus NCOV COVID-19 was born because of the man made 5G mobile network and the nature virus adapt to stay alive (evolution), that is the only reason you have this virus.  
 

Prove me wrong if you or any authority able to tell and have better explanation the true origin of the virus please.  
 If not then my statement is correct.

**Fact 4:**  
 All the positive negative test can only tell you the density of the virus in human body, it cannot detect the “small seed virus”, no any machine able to detect that seed for they are too small.  
 

That is the reason why you have people get reinfected.

**Fact 5:**  
 The NCOV COVID-19 is the most deadly virus humanity ever face in this civilization. If you able to deal and win vs this virus, you will can easily deal with any kind of diseases like HIV, Cancer, SARS, etc.

**Fact 6:**  
 This virus able to fly and swim at the same time and it has the features of many previous virus like SARS + HIV + Ebola + Cancer. So it can spread very fast with high damage in short period of time.

**Fact 7:**  
 You can only reduce the damage and spread rate, but cannot remove it in your life for it already have in all continents on planet Earth.

**Fact 8:**  
 Only you can save you from this virus, no any doctor or any governments, groups can save you from this virus. And the only way to do it is increase your knowledge &amp; wisdom. Do not rely on the authority for they are talking and doing wrong way.

You can see Wuhan as an example, even the top doctor dies because of this virus, which mean even them cannot take care of their life, so how can the government &amp; authority can save you? That why you must become a doctor of your own.

**Fact 9:**  
 I already have a cure and solution this virus NCOV COVID-19 NCOVID2019 or whatever name.  
 I can easily help any victim who got infected “back to life” within maximum 14 days.  
 I can easily help you and your family stay alive from this epidemic event.  
 You just need to understand natural environment language, changing your life style, there is no need for using any machine/technology.

**Want me prove that?**  
 Just give me the info of any victim with test positive/negative who got infected.  
 I can tell them what they should eat, do &amp; stay each day. Then they will easily “back to life” within maximum 14 days.  
 But I need some basic information like the what city are they live, age, their condition, their diet, etc.

If you and your family want to stay safe and alive out of this global epidemic event, I can also able to help you easily from what you should eat, should do, should wear base on your location and your own situation.

I will help you for free of charge, but you must share the my websites with your local people as well.

If you have any questions then you can ask me at website: **freejoy.aimoo.com** or **theworld.data.blog**

I have done some chores on my store, gotten a nice fraction of the prepping supplies on a suitable place and gone outside to some stores and to the Chinese bazaar to get cleaning supplies (and even found 96° alcohol, yay!). 

So far so good. I will rest a bit and on the afternoon go to paint stuff with some aquaintances. You're right on that even with the virus I need to go outside to care for my mental health. 

Probably the feelings of dread and wanting to dissappear will come back at some point, but at least right now I am not feeling like human garbage.

278,Making My Own Hand Sanitizer,"The hand sanitizer is all gone in my area so I bought bottles of Isoproyl  Alcohol and mixing it aloe vera gel. I was guesstimating the proportion, basically 30 percent aloe vera and 70 percent alcohol (the alcohol itself is 99,99 percent pure) so I think mixing them together should produce the recommended 70 percent alcohol ratio

However it is not coming out right. The gel's consistency is not as thick as commercial hand sanitizer and the sanitizer feels harsher on my skin. Also there is a more noticeable smell of alcohol than with the commercial products.

What am I doing wrong?

Can I use something besides aloe vera like a cream hand lotion or will the alcohol break that down?

279,My water prep experience,"I’ve been seeing a lot of condescending “you’re a dummy for prepping water” posts all over reddit. But still, I prepped water. Not because of the virus but because you never know if you may need it. 

On my way home from the store on Tuesday, I heard it. Blasting through my neighborhood was an unmistakable alarm. My sewage pump was broken. Because of course. Of course when I am concerned about viral illness with a clearly defined fecal oral route of infection, I would have to call a plumber to my house.

But thankfully we have been able to get by without an emergency trip to the store. Especially when everyone is clamoring over the supplies that I actually need. I’ve also been able to spot some gaps in my water prep that need to be patched up just in case.

280,Mental preps,"If the following is too woo woo for you, I completely understand, but I feel very compelled right now to share this.  I love this sub, I love how open-minded and kind people here are, and I feel like this is the place I'm supposed to share this.

I am a psychic/medium, but I use my gifts primarily to help animals, because I don't want to get inundated by human spirits.  But this is a message for humans.  I am channeling right now, this isn't coming from me.

The battle we are about to face isn't simply a virus- it's a battle of good and evil.  You only need to look at what China has done to its population to see this.  Since this whole thing started, I've both been drawn to, and they to me, people with gifts.  If you are reading this message, you probably have gifts you are either aware of, or have always suspected but haven't fully acknowledged.  Now is the time to explore them, acknowledge them, and allow them room to breathe, because there's not much time left to get our spiritual ducks in a row.  We are on the precipice of the New Earth we've all heard about and rolled our eyes at.  The earth is cleaning out the old and stagnant.  The children of this planet are going to take things to a new level- doesn't anyone else find it odd they aren't (yet) affected?  

If your physical space is chaos right now (like mine is), take this down time to clean it up.  Dust those shelves, wash the sheets, mop the floors, clean out the cupboards.  Your home is going to be your safe zone, and where you will recharge, and you need it to be peaceful and serene.  Learn how to quiet your mind- the word 'meditate' is almost repulsive, so instead just learn to sit and allow messages to come through.  For me, that's in the shower.  

Stoic mental strength is going to be the difference between making it or not.  If you are a sponge, you need to learn how to shield yourself from other peoples' energy, because it's going to be heavy with fear and chaos.  No matter what situation you're in, you have to stay strong, stay focused, and don't allow other's fear to take you down.  You might lose at least one loved one- prepare your mind for that now- in your heart of hearts you know who it will be, but you also might get surprised.  Be ready for that, because you're not going to have time to fall apart.  This world is about to change in a way we never dreamed would happen in our lifetime.  

The children are here to usher in a new world, and they need to be protected at all costs.  ""Opportunists"" are going to be taking advantage of the chaos, so learn now to keep watch not just on your own children, but those around you.  We are going to be seeing things that turn our blood to ice- we have to get ourselves mentally prepared for this and not succumb to the fear and depression, or the baddies will win.  I know how crazy this all sounds, but I'm going to say it anyway because it doesn't feel like I have a choice- this is a battle for this planet, and it's a battle of good and evil.  This is the turning point for the future of the people that will be left- your children, your grandchildren.  The time to break out of the hypnosis of denial is now.  There is no denying that this virus has been allowed to spread, all you have to do is look at the actions of those that could have stopped this back in January.  Stop calling yourself crazy for prepping- the dividends of this will pay off in spades.  You were given inside information from your guiding spirits, because *you have a job to do in all of this.*  When the time comes, you will know exactly what that job is.  

Right now, in this downtime while we're waiting for the other shoe to drop, is the time to get your spiritual house in order.  It's time to stop listening to the fear, and start listening to things that make you feel good.  Listen to stand-up, listen to spiritual stuff (I'm a big fan of Abraham Hicks), find your happiest memory and spend a lot of time there.  Go out in nature, take care of your body, take a long hot soak in the tub with a good book, give those hands and feet some love.  Get lots of sleep, don't push yourself if you're not feeling it, listen to what your body is telling you.  Enjoy your food, don't worry about dieting, drink lots of water.  If you want to eat cookies for dinner, do it, but eat them with all five senses and experience them.  None of us know how much time we have left on this planet- reach out to those you feel connected with but have lost contact with over the years.  Make amends where you feel you need to, but don't beat yourself up if you don't want to, either.  Sometimes the dissolution of a relationship is for our highest good, and that's okay, it doesn't need to be ""fixed"".  

It's so easy to slip into negativity and depression and futility right now, so we need to keep ourselves in check.  I've done it, and it feels gross.  If the only thing we can do is keep our light on, that's enough.  Stay kind, stay patient with people, and keep your light shining.  There powers that be like to do their deeds in the dark- that's why our light is so important.  People are going to be crawling out of the woodwork trying to bust your light bulb, so protect it like it's a newborn kitten.  

I feel like that's it.  I'm sure this will get downvoted into oblivion, but those that need to hear it will, and that's all I can do.  If anyone feels compelled to reach out to me on the side to explore this further, please do.  Here's a comment I made the other day in another sub on how to ground and shield yourself:

286,Quite buying overpriced stuff,"Being frugal is always a good habit, but in prepping it should be even more so. I keep seeing people posting pics of their prep stashes and I can't help but think that they could have bought 4 times the amount with the same amount of money just going to the right places. As far as I'm tracking, Dollar Tree is a national chain, and yes everything there (you guessed it) is a dollar. A week ago I bought 20 bottles of hand sanitizer, literally the same exact brand/size that is going for 10-20 bucks a piece on eBay right now.  At that same time, hand sanitizer was completely sold out at Walmart. They also carry gallons of bleach and other bulk sanitizers for a dollar.  I encourage everyone to hit the dollar stores this weekend and see for yourself just what is available. You will probably be pleasantly surprised on what you can find there. 

Also, if you're spending $100 on shelving to organize $100 worth of items, you're wrong. I know it looks cool and makes for a good picture, but unless you feel 100% confident that there is literally no better way for you to spend that money, just don't...

To that end, I've been downloading both podcasts and youtube videos to save content locally for later watching.  The program I use is open-source and free.  https://github.com/Tyrrrz/YoutubeDownloader/releases/tag/1.7.3

290,Exercise when limiting outings/ Bugging In,"I just told my trainer that I’m not going to our gym in person for a while bc of COVID-19 and was thinking through a few ways to stay fit. I’m fortunate to afford a great gym that has an app where my trainer can send me workouts he wants me to do. It links to my Apple Watch so there’s still accountability (which I need especially in winter months), but here are some things I keep in my “home gym” kit that can really give you the exercise you need with limited space, means, time. 

-I still feel comfortable running outside in my area for now and will do that with my dog to tire them out. If you do too, this is great even if you’re just starting or doing a couch to 5k type thing. 

-Elastic stretch bands- these are great with different levels of resistance so you can move up or use them differently to really get a burn in. These look like giant rubber bands. 

-Stretch cords: they have handles on both sides so you could wrap one through the other around a sturdy column or something that can handle the extra tension. Again have different levels of resistance.

-jump rope: super simple killer cardio burner.

-you can also use the water your storing for weights if you don’t have any! Even walking around your home with two in hand for a while gets you tired. 

For gamers: if anyone still has their DDR mat there are emulators you can use. The hard levels are actually really good at getting your heart rate up!

Free: body weight exercises. Push ups, squats, planks, lunges. Anything you can just use your own body to do is great!

Also Free: YouTube has yoga and many other exercise videos you can access depending on preference and fitness level. 

I’m sure I’m missing many things but these are things that don’t take up much if any space and are all reasonably priced.

294,STAY VIGILANT ~ Do NOT allow people around you to EAT at your MIND!,"**Stay Vigilant**

If you've been prepping like me, (1st week of February)  you may be starting to ask yourself WHY?  Especially if you have people around you that are questioning your efforts.   DO NOT ALLOW this to happen.  There is plenty to be concerned about.  This is a PANDEMIC.  The reason we're not being told the severity of it is easy to understand when you look at this story about a GIRL that was MUGGED by 15 BOYS in CROWN HEIGHTS NY, for her **SNEAKERS**!

[Vicious Mugging Caught on Video](https://www.foxnews.com/us/vicious-new-york-city-mugging-caught-on-video-nypd)

If a group of boys will be this violent over a pair of sneakers, imagine what they would do if they knew food and meds were running out.  President Trump is aware that we have a highly armed populous.  He's aware that they are a powder keg that could be ignited by the sick and demented LEFT-WINGERS out there.  They would like nothing more than to see Civil Unrest.  It would feed their agenda.

No supplies are coming from OVERSEAS.  Medicine and the creature comforts that we all desire, that make life easier, are no longer coming into the country.

Eventually, farmers and laborers, won't be able to pick the foods and care for their livestock.  What happens when these very people become sick and are expected to continue to supply FOOD, or slaughter the animals we eat.  Will they cross-contaminate our food supply?

Africa and South America are just beginning to see cases, they will surely blossom there and will move UNIMPEDED.  Their health system and the level of education will cause unimaginable horror for them.  The time is now to stay focused, stay above the noise.   DRIVE THE BUS OF YOUR OWN FUTURE.  Maintain your heightened level of awareness.  Continue prepping.  Maintain social distance.  You cannot rely on the government, to be honest about what is happening.  There is far too much at risk if the ECONOMY continues to collapse.

Just like we saw with the Spanish Flu in 1918, Our government and others around the world know, there has to be something to rebuild upon.  Personally, I look at this as the silver lining to the virus.  We have a huge homeless problem across the globe.  We are top-heavy with the elderly population.  We have numerous ""weak"" people who will be CLEANSED.  Nobody has offered up a solution to these GLOBAL problems.....perhaps this is the answer.  You may think I'm a ghoul for having this perspective, but sometimes BRUTAL HONESTY is a difficult pill to swallow.

China is already publicly stating that the USA is to blame for this.  They are attempting to hijack the narrative for histories sake.   

I hope you and those you love stay well.

We'll make it through this together.

304,"Weird times, my journey so far","Hope you do not mind me sharing my journey so far.   
I never ever did any prepping in my life. I always was late with buying food until the last green pea.   
Or when I run out of coffee. Running out of coffee makes me grumpy but i even manage to let that happen a few times in a year.   
I hardly had a stock of anything in my house.

But last oktober 2019. Just out of the blue, no reason i can think off. I decided it was time to make an emergency kit. I did not hide it. Everybody knew about it. This was my mission in life. I need to prep!  
Just in case there is no water, gas, electra. A WTSHTF situation.  
I wanted to make my own emergency kit.  You can buy kits. I just wanted to gather all the things myself.   
So I just began somewhere. With water. I just filled bottles of water. I would buy mineral water later but i started with filling lemonade bottles. Great start!   
I did a lot of research by going to the goverments of different countries.   
All western countries want their citizens to have an emergency kit and be prepared for at least 2 weeks. Some countries a bit longer.   
 I visited all their website FEMA US, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Belgium and my own country the Netherlands.    
Very interesting to compare what they have to say and the emergency supply list they give.  
The lists the goverments give have a lot of similarities but there are some differences. Germany is WOW  that one was a bit to much for me. In amounts of food and stuff.    
My country The Netherlands had the most vague, short and basic emergency list of them all.  This is also the reason i think that not more then 5% of the Dutch population has an emergency kit in their houses. Nobody is prepared here.   
I spend hours  and hours reading topics in  prep-forums or watching  prep youtube videos. It gave me an idea what kind of prepper i want to be. I just want to have a solid basis. For a few months. No more.  

So this whole journey started in october.   
Bought a lot of things like flash-lights, candles, different ways to make fire. I even bought myself a swiss army knife, glow in the dark sticks, paracord, tarps, emergency blankets, ducktape, a solar handcrank analogue radio, ohhh and i bought in a second-hand shop and old 1950s Dutch cooking stove. O boy! what a find!  With lamp-oil i can now cook my own food.   
I also restocked my 20 year old emergency kit. Bought some things that were missing. I made a bug out bag and an EDC kit.   
And i bought of course extra food. Everytime when i went to the store i gave myself the assignment to buy extra things. And look for different products that last a long time. And since i do not own a car. That proces of stocking up on food goes a bit slower since i have to carry all my groceries on my bike. There is so much i can carry. 

The 30th of december 2019 was my last bike trip to the foodstore.  
I had spend more then enough money. So next thing i wanted to do was to test and experience how long i could do with the food in my house. They idea was to stretch it as long as possible. And learn from this experience.  
In the third week of january of not going to the store I was sure I could go on for at least 3 more weeks. Altought i started to miss things like bread and cheese.  


That third week was also the week of Chinees New Year. I heared about the Corona Virus. And OMG my alarm bells went off. My gutt said this is bad!!!.    
And i got very upset because i just ate 3 weeks of my supply.    
I terminated my project and started restocking.   
The great thing now with restocking was that  i had learned from these first 3 weeks of living on my supply that i knew what extra things to buy  So i feel very relaxed now. I have prepared myself.

But these past fews months. O boy!! have they been strange. Did i have some kind of pre-knowing in Oktober? I dont know.. More people had this experience? That the had the deep urge to prepare a few months before?   
My friends and family were laughing at me in October because i was so full of it. I told everybody about it.  And as a messiah i had decided that all my friends and family needed to prep as well. And i showed them what i had bought and gathereed and learned.   
I even bought the SARS coffee table book. I was so serious and commited. But i loved it.  Everybody though i gone mad.

307,How to not touch your face.,"Mods, as this isn't really ""prepping"" I hope this isn't deleted, but I think being mindful of avoiding the virus is just as important as being prepared for the social effects. I'd rather bug in and use my supplies in good health, not stay home and be sick and miserable. 

If anyone else has any good tips please share. 

---

Just my personal experiences and practical measures with teaching myself not to touch my face so much. I actually became mindful of this a couple flu seasons ago in my busy work environment where I handled shared phones, retail money, computers, etc, so these have been helpful for some time now.  (Knock on wood, the last time I had even a moderate cold was early spring 2017, and before that I averaged a mild illness every year or so.)

Eyes:

-Wear glasses. If you have perfect vision, get a fake/fashion set! I'm mildly near sighted and can get by without my glasses but since I started wearing them all the time I find I almost never randomly touch my eyes. If you need them, wear them and if you wear contacts instead, consider switching to your glasses for a while.  If you have to wear your contacts, definitely wash your hands before inserting or removing lenses. 

-Wear makeup. I do most days and so I typically pause before just rubbing eyeliner all over the place.  Use that pause to remember this post and wash your hands first!  (obviously this tip isn't for everyone) 

Mouth/Teeth:

-Chew a piece of gum almost constantly. You can somewhat use it to get food out of your teeth if needed and helps to keep you from absent mindedly chewing on pens, fingernails, etc.

-If you tend to nibble your nails, keep them as short as possible or paint them. 

-Keep a few toothpicks handy. I'm just as guilty as the next person of using a fingernail to remove a stubborn piece of food, but if now that I know I have them handy, I go for that instead.

Nose:

-Probably my weakest area.  I welcome tips on this!  (Obviously I do not pick my inner nose.  Danger!) 

-I still catch myself scratching an itch on the outside of my nose. I stop myself maybe half the time.

-(Anecdotal at best) I eat spicy food at lunch.  I havey own kleenex with me and I blow my nose after I finish eating. I feel like I don't get stuffy for the rest of the day or have the need to sneeze as much. YMMV.

Misc:

-BYO silverware, plates, food, snacks, gum etc to work and keep it away from co workers.

317,"For a reusable half-mask, 3M suggests ""one set of filters will cover at least one pandemic wave""","Somebody linked [a pamphlet on 3M UK website](http://www.3m.co.uk/intl/uk/ohes/segments/healthcare/(9666a\)OH_ReusableTechBulletin_lft.pdf) advertising usage of their reusable half-mask respirators specifically for healthcare use in case of flu pandemic, when coupled with plastic-encased P3 filters (6035 or 6038 in Europe, possibly also 7093 or other similar looking types in the US and other markets). 

While the instructions for cleaning and disinfecting the mask body with soap and wipes are common sense, what's interesting is the bit about filters:

&gt; Q – For how long will a set of particulate filters last in use?

&gt; A – Filters should be changed when they become clogged with particulate contaminant. The wearer can determine when this occurs as it becomes harder to breathe through the filters.The filters are designed to filter out particles in industrial conditions and in concentrations much higher than is likely to be encountered in a pandemic situation. **It is therefore expected that one set of filters will cover at least one pandemic wave**, after which they should be replaced for infection control reasons

So, basically, 3M doesn't think the box filters don't need specific disinfection at all. According to them, you could just wipe down the filter body and keep reusing it, possibly until the end of the pandemic wave, presumed it doesn't get physically clogged like it would in heavy duty dusty environments. The masks have an intake valve that doesn't let moisture from exhalation to get to the filters, and the path of fair through the filter is indirect, so this makes sense.

Therefore, one probably don't need more than a couple of pairs of filters (~$10/pair) for the mask (~$30) to get through this.

321,For those of us that have limited N95 masks or respirators: Universal and reusable virus deactivation system for respiratory protection (makes respirators safe for re-use in pandemics),"""Aerosolized pathogens are a leading cause of respiratory infection and transmission. Currently used protective measures pose potential risk of primary/secondary infection and transmission. Here, we report the development of a universal, reusable virus deactivation system by functionalization of the main fibrous filtration unit of surgical mask with sodium chloride salt. The salt coating on the fiber surface dissolves upon exposure to virus aerosols and recrystallizes during drying, destroying the pathogens. When tested with tightly sealed sides, salt-coated filters showed remarkably higher filtration efficiency than conventional mask filtration layer, and 100% survival rate was observed in mice infected with virus penetrated through salt-coated filters. Viruses captured on salt-coated filters exhibited rapid infectivity loss compared to gradual decrease on bare filters. Salt-coated filters proved highly effective in deactivating influenza viruses regardless of subtypes and following storage in harsh environmental conditions. Our results can be applied in obtaining a broad-spectrum, airborne pathogen prevention device in preparation for epidemic and pandemic of respiratory diseases.""

We have a rotation of meals we use and I’ve always kept about a month of food aside at a minimum but recently increased our goal to 3 months. There’s a good spreadsheet floating around here somewhere that I used to tally calories, but I generally just sort of multiply our weekly grocery list. Another (maybe?) useful resource would be Dr Greger’s Daily Dozen list. Helpful for putting together a daily meal plan and making sure you’re hitting the goals of having a varied plant based diet.

329,So my husband told his relatives I'm prepping,"Throwaway here, as hubby is a redditor as well.

Basically what the title says - my guy shared with his family that we're doing some prep work and I'm seriously mad with him. First off, I was laughed at when I said we should prep like a month ago. We didn't cause he said it's crazy, and his family has the ""Just the flu"" mentality. When this started going...viral, lol, and cases started popping up everywhere, he finally agreed and on I went. Right now, I have about 2 months worth of shelf-stable food, frozen stuff, household essentials, medical stuff, etc.  We decided that we're not going t share with anyone that we're prepping and kept it on the DL. That is, until today, when he casually mentioned telling his close family about our stuff and they jokingly said they're coming over if this gets bad, while still thinking it's crazy and I'm just paranoid and media brain-washed. Now I get why so much of you guys are referring to prepping as ""a fight club"".  I feel like a sociopath for not wanting to share my things, but I also feel like that's fair, since I've tried to tell all these people that it might be a good idea to prep, etc and they made the decision not to while I spent a lot if money and effort into stocking up.

340,"I'm prepped as much as I am willing, but now I'm anxious I've just wasted money and effort.","I'll be the first to admit I'm a total panic prepper. About 2 weeks ago is when I started prepping thanks to this sub.  

At first I just bought twice as much groceries. Then I realized that this wasnt an urgent drop everything and exit civilization. So a couple days later we bought the expected toilet paper, rice, beans and a few other things. We also bought lots of frozen fruits, veggies and froze some added meat. 

Then I realized that living off rice and beans would really suck if the freezer didn't keep or we ran out of food. So off I went to do more shopping. I bought the cans of meat, veggies, fruits, etc. 

I'm at the point where I've spent all the money I'm willing to spend on this. We have the list of foods everyone recommends plus cleaning supplies and a little medicine.  If push comes to shove and we had to live off our supply I think it would last about a month for 2 adults and a kid, maybe longer, math isn't my strongest subject. 

My last trip was this morning. I bought my weekly groceries and then added to our stash. I noticed though that pretty much everything was still in stock. Toilet paper, cans of food, etc. The only thing that I couldn't find was my brand of oats and dried milk, I got evaporated instead. 

Now I can't help but think, what if this is all for nothing and I've just wasted hundreds of dollars?! 

We're supposed to buy things we'd normally eat, and I tried, but honestly we mainly eat fresh produce, fresh meat, etc. I go grocery shopping once or twice a week and I barely even look in the caned food section unless a recipe calls for a can of diced tomatoes or something. So while I got food that I thought we'd be ok eating if need be, I'm fairly sure if we don't need it in an emergency it will sit on these shelves until expired. I might use a can of peas here and there but I can't fathom using this much canned tuna or spam in our every day lives. 

Im not so worried about the actual virus, the reason I started prepping was I was concerned of food shortages and supply chain disruptions. I didn't want to be in a position where the local stores were out of food and we had nothing to eat. But that definitely doesn't seem to be an issue in my area at all. The stores are fully stocked except the expected masks and hand sanitizer. 

I can't shut in, infact I have to go to the doctors once a week. So if the virus takes over I'll be visiting the worst place possible, the hospital, every week. I'm likely going to contract it if it gets bad. But, I'm still definitely taking precautions now. We mainly stay home, no public places with lots of people unless it's running a needed errand.

I just feel like if the stores are able to stay stocked, and I'm going to be exposed either way, maybe all this prepping was a wasted effort and money.",PandemicPreps,1583634446,breeskys,51,1,True,2020-03-07 18:27:26,first admit total panic prepper weeks ago started prepping thanks sub first bought twice much groceries realized wasnt urgent drop everything exit civilization couple days later bought expected toilet paper rice beans things also bought lots frozen fruits veggies froze added meat realized living rice beans would really suck freezer keep ran food went shopping bought cans meat veggies fruits etc point spent money willing spend list foods everyone recommends plus cleaning supplies little medicine push comes shove live supply think would last month adults kid maybe longer math strongest subject last trip morning bought weekly groceries added stash noticed though pretty much everything still stock toilet paper cans food etc thing find brand oats dried milk got evaporated instead help think nothing wasted hundreds dollars supposed buy things normally eat tried honestly mainly eat fresh produce fresh meat etc go grocery shopping twice week barely even look caned food section unless recipe calls diced tomatoes something got food thought ok eating need fairly sure need emergency sit shelves expired might use peas fathom using much canned tuna spam every day lives worried actual virus reason started prepping concerned food shortages supply chain disruptions want position local stores food nothing eat definitely seem issue area stores fully stocked except expected masks hand sanitizer shut infact go doctors week virus takes visiting worst place possible hospital every week likely going contract gets bad still definitely taking precautions mainly stay home public places lots people unless running needed errand feel like stores able stay stocked going exposed either way maybe prepping wasted effort money,first admit total panic prepper week ago start prep thank sub first bought twice much groceri realiz wasnt urgent drop everyth exit civil coupl day later bought expect toilet paper rice bean thing also bought lot frozen fruit veggi froze ad meat realiz live rice bean would realli suck freezer keep ran food went shop bought can meat veggi fruit etc point spent money will spend list food everyon recommend plu clean suppli littl medicin push come shove live suppli think would last month adult kid mayb longer math strongest subject last trip morn bought weekli groceri ad stash notic though pretti much everyth still stock toilet paper can food etc thing find brand oat dri milk got evapor instead help think noth wast hundr dollar suppos buy thing normal eat tri honestli mainli eat fresh produc fresh meat etc go groceri shop twice week bare even look cane food section unless recip call dice tomato someth got food thought ok eat need fairli sure need emerg sit shelv expir might use pea fathom use much can tuna spam everi day live worri actual viru reason start prep concern food shortag suppli chain disrupt want posit local store food noth eat definit seem issu area store fulli stock except expect mask hand sanit shut infact go doctor week viru take visit worst place possibl hospit everi week like go contract get bad still definit take precaut mainli stay home public place lot peopl unless run need errand feel like store abl stay stock go expos either way mayb prep wast effort money

346,Arts and Crafts for the Apocalypse: U-Haul Foot Box Care Packages,"This post is about preparing and using boxes to store items.

A lot of people like to fold boxes so they make a star formation, this only makes a box weaker. It breaks some of the bonds in the cardboard, and the bottom is more likely to fall out anyway. The bottom part of a box has two sets of flaps; when you fold the first two on the inside in, it’s best to put a square of packing tape across them, an inch on either side, so that the flaps won’t open. When you fold the outer halves over that, put a square of pack tape across the middle as well. This will keep the bottom nice and squared off. A strip of packing tape should go along the seam and a couple inches up either side.

Most boxes have a handle on either side, you can make one using box cutters if you need to. Reinforce the handle with packing tape so they’re less likely to rip, and make it so when you lift the box, the handles push the top seam inward (so parallel to the top seam). You probably don’t want people seeing what’s inside; a wide ribbon cut from a garbage bag taped above the handle on the inside of the box will stop this. Leave some slack if you decide to tape the bottom of the ribbon so it will move when you lift the box.

It’s best to put a clear recycling bag in the box; this stops water from getting in. Just make sure that you only tie the top of the bag lightly. You can cut a square from another box just large enough to cover the top before you close it. This will stop people from seeing from above what you have if you need to put something extra in. Don’t tape the top inside flaps, but do put one square of tape across the outer top flaps, and another square to secure each end edge of the top seam so they won’t steeple up. Squeeze the box in while taping so that the top is not as likely as shift around. This will keep your boxes from sagging and keep it squared off when you stack them.

If you pack a box with preps, make sure there’s a variety of items. An extra toothbrush, a razor, a pack of baby wipes, a box cutter, sanitizer, even a cheap can opener, along with whatever cans of food or water you’re putting in. You can but a layer of soda cans on the bottom, topped with a square of cardboard, and then layer other items on top. This way you get beverages, food, equipment without making a box too heavy. You never know when you’ll only be able to take one at a time.

Keep an empty box or two that are prepped in your trunk; you can put items you’ve just bought in them so that your neighbours won’t quite know what you have.

351,Arts and Crafts for the Apocalypse: Magic Gloves vs Blue Gloves.,"Magic gloves are the black stretchy gloves you can find at a dollar store. They have some benefits over blue gloves for people who are not in healthcare.

Magic gloves let your hands breathe. They don’t scare people (you can wear blue gloves under them if you like). Because they’re fuzzy you’ll think twice about picking something up or touching your face. You can wipe them with a saniwipe while wearing them, because you’re getting very minimal of it on your hands. That stops you from having to spray them. You can reuse them. You can keep them in a breathable container, such as KIS boxes stacked: KIS box with used magic gloves in them, unlidded, with a KIS box stacked on top, glove/box/glove/box, that way you have a queue of reusable gloves. If you decide to wash them (wash them before you first wear them because they smell like plastic), double safety pin the pairs together so you at least know which are pairs.

When you take off your gloves, take the first off by the heel of the hand (you should be able to take it off without turning it inside out, four fingers still in the glove, use your bare thumb to push the other off from inside the glove. Now you have two gloves held between thumb and fingers, each inside one glove. Put them into a (optionally cloth) bag with the other hand. You should have a few Ziploc bags and napkins in your pocket in case you need to store something, scratch, or sneeze. When you take off your gloves, be sure to sanitize or wash. Using magic gloves makes you use less sanitizer overall.

Blue gloves give you a false sense of security. Because your hands get wet and clammy underneath you could develop a rash or pickling of your fingers. If something liquid gets under your gloves you might feel compelled not to take them off (if you don’t have an extra pair on you). Blue gloves do get broken, often, especially if they are just a tad tight.",PandemicPreps,1583648191,ce34d7b7,0,1,True,2020-03-07 22:16:31,magic gloves black stretchy gloves find dollar store benefits blue gloves people healthcare gloves let hands breathe scare people wear blue gloves like fuzzy think twice picking something touching face wipe saniwipe wearing getting minimal hands stops spray reuse keep breathable container kis boxes stacked kis box used magic gloves unlidded kis box stacked top glove box glove box way queue reusable gloves decide wash wash first wear smell like plastic double safety pin pairs together least know pairs take gloves take first heel hand able take without turning inside four fingers still glove use bare thumb push inside glove two gloves held thumb fingers inside one glove put optionally cloth bag hand ziploc bags napkins pocket case need store something scratch sneeze take gloves sure sanitize wash using magic gloves makes use less sanitizer overall gloves give false sense security hands get wet clammy underneath could develop rash pickling fingers something liquid gets gloves might feel compelled take extra pair blue gloves get broken often especially tad tight,magic glove black stretchi glove find dollar store benefit blue glove peopl healthcar glove let hand breath scare peopl wear blue glove like fuzzi think twice pick someth touch face wipe saniwip wear get minim hand stop spray reus keep breathabl contain ki box stack ki box use magic glove unlid ki box stack top glove box glove box way queue reusabl glove decid wash wash first wear smell like plastic doubl safeti pin pair togeth least know pair take glove take first heel hand abl take without turn insid four finger still glove use bare thumb push insid glove two glove held thumb finger insid one glove put option cloth bag hand ziploc bag napkin pocket case need store someth scratch sneez take glove sure sanit wash use magic glove make use less sanit overal glove give fals sens secur hand get wet clammi underneath could develop rash pickl finger someth liquid get glove might feel compel take extra pair blue glove get broken often especi tad tight

If you bought some or are thinking of getting some, 4/5 of us that were there for lunch liked it. It was similar to a griddled hot dog or one you cooked under a broiler. 

The texture is softer. Too me, that looks like a plus if you are cooking for an older relative who does not have sodium issues but has dental issues. 

Would I buy spam on purpose during a time I was not getting ready to be stuck at home? No. But it’s fine. I’m going to get a second case, assuming Costco still has any.

368,Small PSA: Your hot water tank acts as de-facto water storage,"The water in the tank is potable water (where do you think the hot water from your faucet comes from?) as long as water treatment is functioning.  In the event that you lose water pressure entirely, the tank will still retain its contents.  And thus, you have likely anywhere from 30-50 gallons of water in there.  If you have a tankless water heater, 1) I'm jealous, 2) this PSA does not apply to you.  

Before accessing your tank's water, be sure to turn off the gas (or, if it's electric, find the breaker for it and flip it off) and let the tank cool.  Unless your goal is to scald yourself, in which case skip this step.  It could take as long as 12 hours to cool down, maybe longer if the tank is insulated or you have the temperature set REALLY high.  

There should be a pressure relief valve near the bottom of the water tank (2/3rds of the way down or so).  This is not what you are looking for.  Instead, go all the way to the bottom, and look for the drain valve.  Because it's so low to the ground, the odds are that you'll need a hose of some sort to connect to it.  Food-grade hoses are a thing that exist, but a garden hose would work too.   Note that fluid dynamics still apply here.  As long as the water level in the tank is HIGHER than the container you're trying to pour it into, water will flow freely.  When that changes, you will have to either elevate the tank (have fun with that) or find a way to depress your water container's elevation (usually much easier).

370,Should an 80-year-old stop non-essential chemotherapy to better her odds of fighting the virus?,"Not sure if this is the right sub to ask but y’all are my people so I come to you for help!

My question is: if she were to stop the treatment, how long would it take for her to not be immuno-compromised? Or put another way, should she just stop now?

381,Arts and Crafts for the Apocalypse: Soda Can Box Garbage Bins,"Did you ever notice how much you throw out? In normal situations, feh, you have a box of pop cans you finished. Crush it and toss. In a not quite yet lockdown situation, when it’s clear there’s a problem but garbage removal is still going, that’s a shining beacon that have some nice preps. 

Those long boxes you get soda cans in can be used as makeshift garbage cans just for cans. You’ll see a middle cutout where usually you lug the box to your car. You probably rip the box open from that point. But instead, take the distance of one can from top and cut a flap using a box cutter (on the long side with the handle already in it). You should end up with a flap one can wide that flaps up out from the box when it’s lying on the ground. This way your soda can box has more integrity should you get bored of the same beverage and want to open another and stack them.

This box with the can sized cutout flap is going to become a makeshift garbage bin that looks like one those butt stop receptacles for cigarettes. When you stand it on one end with the flap up you can pop old (crushed, washed out, and dried cans) in it and will serve as a convenient container for about 30 cans, or the equivalent of 2 and a half full soda can boxes. When its full you can store them lying down and stack them.

If you’re done with a soda can box (or any box) and you know it is useless for anything you need, you should be cutting that box up into squares. If you cut them into 4x4 inch squares you can... pop them into one of your soda can box bins.

387,"Although I prepared I can’t shake an ominous feeling, I think COVID is already widespread and I’m very worried about my elderly relatives.","Hey, hope you all are coping alright. First, I started prepping for this in a very proactive manner.  Set my plans in place late January after watching the Wuhan situation and scrambled as best I could all through February to prepare. I feel pretty good about my state of preparedness, meaning that I could easily stay home for months and survive (for context I’m a single Mom with a 5 year old). I got food, household supplies (just enough, not hoarding) and bumped up my wilderness gear with a few pieces I’ve been wanting to add to my kit anyway. Basically, I prepared like there would be a 3 month blizzard (which I actually endured as a child, so thinking about these types of things isn’t foreign to me).

However, what is really getting me upset and worried is not just the health risks to my older family and community members, but the plunging economy.  Specifically, what about all the people my parents age (mid 60s) that are blue collar middle class that are counting on cashing in their 401ks and various accounts and now are literally fucked by the tanking economy?!?  You can preach “smart” investing all you want, but they really are getting hit the hardest here.  Not only do they risk death, but now very well may stand to lose everything they worked their whole lives for!  

Look, I am worried about the possible damage that I could possibly sustain to my lungs from an infection... but I am much more worried about all the people 60+ that could literally lose their ability to support themselves in retirement, if they survive!  It’s not like regular folks have a dedicated broker that can fine tune their portfolios to respond to financial crises... I’d actually argue that their portfolios will be abused by those that are trying to work some sort of market “magic”. I know it’s a rant, but I’m getting upset. 

More context, I live in a smallish community in the Rocky Mountains. We do have a University and a lot of international travel occurs in the community, so I think that negates any idea that our isolated location keeps us safe. This week just rolled on like a tsunami, for me.  Not just the news breaking, but personally. In just 6 days, I learned of my (immune compromised)aunt getting pneumonia... she died less than 30 hours later!  Sure, it could just be the regular flu, but the quickness of how it occurred made me suspicious of it possible being COVID (NE Ohio in her case, for those wondering). My mom flew out for her funeral four days ago (out of DIA) and I talked to her about preventive measures she should take while traveling (my parents are 64 and she was receptive).  The day my mom left my dad got sick.... fever, aches, coughing... bad COUGH... said he couldn’t sleep or his lung would get “filled with gunk”, as he put it. I dropped off a grocery haul for him on Thursday and have checked in via phone 3x a day since. He says he’s starting to feel better, but that it comes in waves and it’s one step forward three steps back. I told him to call me or the hospital immediately if he feels like he’s having trouble breathing. He’s in pretty darn good health for his age.  Two years ago he was diagnosed with HBP, but he changed his diet and habits and reversed his health issues, so it’s hard to see him have to sit at home sick when he’s normally out walking/hiking for nearly 6 hours a day. I’m hoping all this work he’s done helps him recover, but it’s shocking to see him so laid up after not seeing him get sick for many years. My mom has severe arthritis and inflammation, she recently had a shingles flair up, so I’m concerned her immune system would be totally overwhelmed by a virus like this.

389,Reminder to take care of everything you will need to do in the next few months now.,"Get your yearly eye exam if it’s coming up and you think you need a new prescription. Glasses can take weeks to get back, though places like LensCrafters will do them in an hour or so. You don’t want to be without good vision. While your at it, if you where glasses but not contacts get a pair of prescription sunglasses, polarized if you can afford it. They are amazing.

Go to your dentist and get I’m your teeth cleaned! Take care of that tooth pain now!! If shtf dentists may not even be open, or they may be cash only. Who knows? Also make sure your nightgaurd or retainer is looking good or get a new one if you need it (and can afford it.). Thy can also take weeks to get back.

Kids have braces? See their orthodontist soon if they need it to have them make their adjustments.

Girls get your Pap smears if you’re due! Make sure everything down there is in good working order. Consider your birth control and make sure you have enough. That includes condoms. If shipping is delayed you do Not want to be without those ;)

Follow up with any health issues you have been putting off seeing a doctor about. If the hospitals are crowded routine exams are going to be low on the list of priorities. Now is the time to know if you need to be on meds, have surgery, make lifestyle changes etc. especially anything heart related. I have an old knee injury that’s been acting up and I’ll be going back to my physical therapist because being able to run is important to me and running and walking long distances could be important to me soon for more than just fitness reasons. 


Get your car looked at finally to see what that noise is! Get whatever general maintenance is recommended, fluids changed, etc especially if it’s an older car. 

Get your pets their yearly vet exam soon if it’s coming up! Make sure your dog has their heartworm meds and make sure you have frontline, whatever else you need as we move it into the warmer months.

Get your spring cleaning done now! While it’s safe to open windows and go to the store to buy what you need. Also if you have gardens make sure you enough fertilizer etc to keep them going.

Pay for any yearly bills that are coming up! Things like car inspection and insurance are things you don’t want to forget to pay.


Let me know if there is anything I’m forgetting! I’m sure there is a lot, this is just the first things that came to mind.

All of my family is in a rural community in upstate New York and have access to land, water, and just generally more live-off-the-land type capabilities if SHTF. 

I certainly don’t want to spread the virus by traveling during these early days but if it means being stuck in Europe for years I’m not sure it’s a good idea to get comfortable here.

401,I feel like I became a prepper just in time...,"About a month ago, I was up late looking on Amazon, and the thought hit me to look for masks. Just to have something to look at and maybe have since I was reading on Reddit it was a good idea. And it shocked me there were none available. I buy EVERYTHING on Amazon or online elsewhere. I work a lot, and when I have time I don't want to go to Walmart and be around people, honestly. So the thought that there was something I could NOT get online without paying gouged up prices really shocked me. I looked at other stores online and spent a couple of hours snooping around until I found a proper mask at a random allergy store (sold out now). It felt good to know it was on its way and I had SOMETHING.

Then I started doing the research, things I would need for prepping in general. Footnote: I am online a LOT. One of those people who make their money by just being better than other people at using Google. So I noticed trends that night, prepper food sold out on Amazon...a bottle of bleach was going for way more and the stock was low. Things that should be available to ship from Walmart are pick up only like soap and toilet paper. Thanks to this I was able to get a bit of bleach and hand sanitizer before that all happened recently, BUT:

**I knew I had to get some things, be prepared.** The fact I could not easily go to Amazon and get something simple was scary. The reality that things like food would always be 5 min away if I needed it that moment, was shattered. What if, I could not leave my house? Or would be forced to go to the store with people who might be sick or desperate?

I do not want to fight panicked people for food or toilet paper after a winter storm or earthquake or you know...a pandemic. *I think I got in at justtttt the right time*. I was barely able to get things like a p100 mask with some carbon filters from 2 different random places. So use those google skills and think about places you would not normally look for prepping stuff. Like that random allergy store. We got food, water, gas, medicine, thanks to reading posts here.

I researched here and we are at the point we feel comfortable to stay in our home for an extended period of time, for whatever could happen. I mean, there is a ton more I can do....but I feel like we have the basics and want to build from there over time. I am so glad we started when we did. Even if nothing comes of this virus, I feel we have a foundation we can build on over time if something ever did happen. An icy storm, earthquake, shortage of gas, whatever, I want to be prepared so I don't have to fight people for something.

The information here has been **invaluable**. My advice to add, look at trends of how things are being sold on Amazon. Out of stock? No more prime? Only 3rd party sellers? That may be what goes next. Snoop around, be prepared.

402,"""What does a pandemic have to do with buying so much bottled water?""","""Isn't that just panicking? Why do you think that some people being sick is going mean that somehow your water will stop flowing?""

A few years ago I lived in an apartment complex that had hundreds of units. The plumbing in our neighborhood was subpar and it seemed like the water was shut off once or twice a year while they attempted to make repairs; usually the interruption lasted several hours at most. The last time before I moved the water was scheduled to be off for one day, but the repair crew ran into more trouble than they expected and the water was actually off for a week. 

After the second day the management company brought in a giant water tanker truck and everyone who lived on the property had to line up with whatever containers they had to haul water by hand back to their apartments. Young professionals, families with several children, old people who lived by themselves, people with disabilities, everyone lined up day after day for every single drop of water that they needed for cooking, cleaning, bathing, and anything else.

Now imagine if something like this happened during a pandemic. Would you want to stand in line with hundreds of other people who may be contagious? Would you want to drink water from a communal source that hundreds of people were touching over and over? What if the truck drivers or the people who filled the truck were sick? What if the workers whose job is was to dig up and fix the pipes were quarantined at home and couldn't get it fixed in only a week?

Water treatment plants and pumping facilities continue to function because healthy people show up to work every day. Those plants run on electricity, and electrical production facilities and maintenance crews continue to function because healthy people show up to work every day. Almost all of those vital employees drive to work, and their cars are run by gas that comes from pumps that are powered by electricity. For that matter, almost every gas station in my city has only one or two employees working at a time. All it would take is a few sick employees and each of them would be shut down for lack of manpower, whether or not the electricity was still working. Round and round it goes.

Look around your house and realize that everything that you have may be the last of it for an unknown period of time, including water and electricity and other utilities that you may rely on. The problems that a pandemic may cause are not always obvious at first glance.

We live in a world where everything is interconnected. As a friend of mine who likes to mix metaphors recently said, all it takes is one falling domino to bring down the whole house of cards.

This sub is for preppers. We understand that the time for self-sufficiency will come. It may be a small inconvenience or a large tragedy, and the reasons and particulars and consequences may not seem obvious beforehand.

407,Questions from a retail employee,"So I'm 22 years old, I live with 3 other people in my house. I work in retail in Minnesota, which has recently had two confirmed cases (one in my county.) I pay ~$265 a month for my rent and phone bill combined, which isn't much at all, but I'm renting space with my SO in her mother's house. But I don't usually make more than $1000 a month, especially this time of year. I have some money saved in the bank though. I realize that working in retail makes me an easy target for this virus because I see hundreds if not thousands of people every day and I'm constantly touching things that aren't clean (door handles, scanners, walkies) that other employees and customers use, but I do wash and sanitizer my hands at any opportunity.


My questions are:

1. If I have enough money to pay rent for a couple months, is it foolish to take a month of unpaid vacation to stay home while things in the US get bad? I won't be making money since it's unpaid but like I said, I do have a bit saved up. I have also already bought supplies to last myself a while but not enough for the whole family.

2. If I do decide to not work for a month, my SO and her mother, sister, and roommate will continue to work at their jobs. Which means if they get it they'll probably pass it on to me anyway, so will that even be worth it?

3. Also, if I do this, is a month going to be enough time or should stay out longer if I can?

409,It's surreal to watch an event you prep'd for actually happen ..,"How do you all feel right now ?

I think the word I would use is ""awe"" ..

1 : an emotion variously combining dread, veneration, and wonder that is inspired by authority or by the sacred or sublime - Merriam Webster

That's how it feels ... dread, check.  I don't know about veneration, but definitely wonder.  Inspired by authority and the sacred and the sublime in the sense that it's nature doing what nature does .. it's like the feeling you get watching a volcano erupt, or video of an earthquake destroying a city .. you just kind of stand there wide eyed watching it happen and can barely believe it's happening.

That's pretty much how I feel ... even though I'm as prepared as I reasonably can be for it.  I kind of glance through the threads and read the titles one by one, in awe that it's happening almost exactly like we said it would ... I kind of feel like the joker when he said ""This is exactly how I imagined it .."".  Except we aren't imagining it ... it's literally happening right before our eyes.

It's like almost exactly what I wrote about 28 days ago ... The ""moment of clarity"" when the mindset of the populace changes ... (long with no TL;DR)  ..

411,Medical care without leaving your home,"Some coworkers were chatting about not wanting to visit doctors offices at the moment due to a large verified cluster in our area (as well as flu circulating). But a couple people were not aware they could get advice or a consultation by phone or video. Here are some of the things we discussed. Please add your suggestions as well!

1) Talk to a nurse. 

Many insurance companies or company benefits offer a 24-hour nurse line. Check the back of your insurance card or your insurance/benefits paperwork. Great for simple health questions like “should I go to the doctor or ride this illness out at home?” or “how can I relieve this cough, a lozenge isn’t helping?”

2) Video chat with a doctor. 

The Amwell app offers video doctor visits for $69, payable via credit card. 

If you happen to have insurance it may cover part of the visit. I’ve used this service several times - for a flu, when my kid got pinkeye, etc. Always been happy with the service. 

3) Call your pharmacist.

For questions regarding which cold/fever medicine you can safely take at the same time as others, or what to take for your cough, don’t forget you can ask your pharmacist. I’ve always found them happy to provide advice on over the counter medications as well as prescriptions.

The  authority, government and many organization are hiding a lot of real  info about the new corona virus from the public for whatever reasons  like lose the regime, cause chaos or continue enslave the people, not  just only China, Vietnam must also including USA, Europe, etc. All over  place.

So if you are seeking for  the truth information, real knowledge, uncensored news, open discussion,  cure &amp; solution for the new corona virus named as NCOV, COVID-19 or  SARS-COV-2, then the only webpage online is **theworld.data.blog** and **freejoy.aimoo.com**.

The  fact is that the media &amp; government are toying with people’s life.  They are only promoting fear and scare to face the truth. They were not  telling the real information about the corona virus from the beginning  and probably in the future as well.

Even  I as a Savior want to telling you the truth, real information about  this epidemic with just text-based message, they think me as fear-maker,  and delete all the messages online. Many of my information now even  scientist was confirmed like the started for this epidemic event from  October/November or the real features of this virus, but many still not  yet confirmed and verified yet.

If  they say cannot talk in the public or big media sites, then it would be  ok, but instead they are deny in all fake free speech websites as well.

You  need to understand that even the top government officials, top doctors  who have access to top notch medical care had died because of this new  corona virus, they cannot protect themselves so there is freaking any  reason they can protect normal people like most of you.

The  new corona virus is not yet peak, the full strength of that virus will  only appear in the summer time. The current situation is too dangerous  for normal people to deal with.

That  why from now I will provide free working cure &amp; solution at private  matter for all of you, if you are rich (have more than 5 millions USD  worth of asset) then you must donate money, but all with restrict  conditions and limited time. But only at **theworld.data.blog** or **freejoy.aimoo.com**.

But  if you are willing to open your mind, want to face the scary hard  truth, accept new knowledge then you can visit that websites. If you are  the anti-christ with big ego and do not want to change, then do not  visit.

Remember everything has the limit and I have the final decision of anything on that website.

The  authority cannot save you, only you can save you, and only the savior  can give you real working advice, cure &amp; solution to overcome this  crazy epidemic event.

418,Best way to estimate how long you’re food will last?,"Tl;dr how to best estimate how long food will last for a family of 5 including 3 boys age 15, 12, and 8? Sketch up some menus? Straight calorie counts?


With the coronavirus lurking, we’ve added to what I call our ‘comfortable prep.’ Meaning food stuffs that aren’t offensive to any of our three boys, aren’t difficult to prepare by one of the kids (or a sick adult). Decent variety, etc. Ravioli, easy Mac, spaghetti, applesauce, nuts, green beans, etc. 

A situation where I’m sick, stuck inside with my SO and the three boys (15, 12, and 8), in a 1100 sq foot house, for days on end sounds potentially stressful. Adding in the fight and dramatics at trying to get them to eat rice and beans gives me anxiety just to imagine. If we’re stuck for months - we have long term preps, but we want a more comforting comfortable 2-4 weeks prep for potential isolation. 

The issue now is I think we’re good, but I’m also worried I’m overestimating (which I know is easy to do) and I need to estimate calories.

419,Pantry recipes,"Hello all, 

I became a prepper back in May before there was ever a need. Talk about timing! As a Floridian I got hurricanes down pat. But I was going over my staples and was concerned about meals I’d make that would be missing some key item for a recipe. And I’m going through it now. 

Sure we can toss beans and rice and some form of meat in, but if I’m going to have the time and the grid, I’m going to enjoy myself. Unless there’s rationing of course.

Long intro short question: what are some recipes that you all might make? 

For example, I have a meat sauce that becomes lasagna which freezes well. I also have a 7 bean bake that keeps and freezes well. The chicken soup is already is already in the freezer (thank Costco for those big birds). Considering adding a casserole with canned chicken, frozen shredded cheese if it comes to it (heard whole blocks crumble on defrost) and placeholder veggies.

422,"School discourages use of ""typical masks,"" as they increase the risk of contracting a virus","I attend a small school, where we have 1 confirmed case in the county. I've been emailing our administration about moving towards tele-schooling and have been met with much resistance. They sent out an update on the situation to all the students today and I thought it was interesting what they said about wearing masks. While I understand that the regular surgical masks are intended to be donned by a sick person to prevent the spread of illness, would wearing one as a healthy person really increase your risk of infection? Also, there was no mention of any other kinds of protective masks/respirators other than the ""typical masks available at the drug store."" 

Quote taken from school email:   
"" Note: The typical masks available at the drug store do not protect against any virus. They may increase the risk of contracting a virus if one comes in contact with the virus.

423,Feminine hygiene - products &amp; practices,"Hey guys,

I just wanted to note some important things to purchase, and practices to follow in order to keep safe and healthy during this times/in life. 

To stock:

Period items (obvi) - disposable tampons, disposable or reusable pads/undies, menstural cup. 

Condoms - prevent pregnancy and overall mess, which could lead to UTI. 

Monistat - yeast infection relief.

Cystoplus - cystitis pain relief from UTIs. Ingredient is sodium citrate. (this does not cure a UTI) 

D mannose pills/powder - help prevent UTIs. E. coli will attach to d-mannose and not multiply in bladder. Might alleviate UTI pain. 

Probiotics - help regulate gut bacteria, prevent yeast infections; will need in case of antibiotic use.

~~~~
To practice:

If possible, purchase a hand held bidet. It will actually keep you clean and prevent UTIs. Spray from the front NEVER from the back.

If not possible, purchase a lota pot. It's similar to a watering can and you can use to rise yourself after the bathroom to clean the area. If you are not comfortable rinsing the back then even just rinsing the front will help. 

ALWAYS body shower after sex. If you have a hand held shower attachment just quickly squat in the shower and rinse down front and back to move any nasties. I usually use soap to wash behind each time after sex just as an extra precaution.

I dunno if this needs to be said, but I heard some people don't wash their bum in even normal showers... What da heck. Please spread your cheeks and wash your bum. 

Wear fresh, clean undies daily. Change after exercise/heavy perspiration. 

~~~~
Closing notes:

Always drink plenty of fluids to flush bacteria away/out from urethra.

Cranberry juice is not necessary. But it does taste good, especially if you have to drink the Cystoplus - I find it gross and it masks the taste.

And finally, PLEASE GO TO THE DOCTOR IF YOU GET A UTI. They do not heal on their own and you WILL need antibiotics. Otherwise you risk infection spreading to your kidneys, and eventual spesis. Many clinics can prescribe via skype, and you just have to go pick up at your pharmacy. 

I kinda made this because I feel this info needed to be put in one place.

425,"As requested, here's how I make biltong! (air dried meat, similar to jerky but easy to make in your garage)","Biltong - a delicious, South African air dried meat. It's extremely easy to make in your garage, you just need a biltong box (somewhere to hang the meat as it dries) a fan, S shaped hooks, and a marinading container. I've taken a few photos of my biltong box and so on, mine is a very basic DIY box made of a wooden frame, hinged lid, dowel rods at the top, and flyscreen stapled to the outside of the box - but you can also buy specialty biltong boxes.

I just typed up my recipe and a bunch of little notes on the various steps, biltong can vary from quite 'wet' and soft, to very 'dry' and chewy, that mostly comes down to preference. My notes are a combination of a couple recipes, tweaked over the years, method, and general tips/observations for anyone who hasn't made biltong (or even seen it) before. There's a fair bit online on making biltong and DIY biltong boxes, but this is how I've made it since I was a kid - gradually refined over 20-ish years

This is quite a long post, and I have repeated a few points throughout, and included a couple versions on the 'salt mix' you will use when marinading. Biltong is so easy when it's done right - you just slice up your beef, marinade with brown vinegar and the salt mix, then hang it up and leave it to dry (with a fan pointing at the box) I put as many details in as possible, as this is AIR DRYING raw meat - but honestly, a child can make it, it's that simple (I started when I was in primary school) Just make sure you marinade and hang it properly, with good air flow.

------

**I will be making a batch of biltong this week, probably in the next couple days. I will take photos of each step and post them as I go along. It usually takes me less than 1 week, from buying the meat to eating/storing it**


---

Some photos of my biltong box, marinading containers, butchers hooks, and the 'real'/original recipe I started with

----

*Apologies for any typos/minor errors, as I just typed this up from the top of my head. I have ADHD, so it took A LOT of concentration to get it this sensical*

---

**Ok, here we go**

Beef topside or silverside is most often used. You want a cut that you could use for steaks, but the cheaper cuts are OK. You can also use kangaroo, venison, ostrich (??) and similar meats. I've only ever made it with beef though, and tried venison (but I am not a fan of venison, and avoid it when there any other options)


-----

For 2 kg meat


**Marinade:**

* Brown vinegar - approx 1/2 cup


**Salt mix:**


* Rock salt, coarse (not sea salt) - 1 cup
* Coriander seeds (roasted) - ground
* Pepper (can use white pepper, more delicate flavour)
* Brown sugar - 1/2 cup
* Bicarb soda - 1 tsp


**My version of the salt mix:**

* 1 cup coarse rock salt
* 2 TBSP brown sugar
* 1 TBSP pepper
* 1 TBSP coriander seeds
(put the pepper and coriander in a pepper mill to grind it up, then mix the whole lot together)

* (I prefer white pepper, as I'm not a fan of the heavy pepper flavour. That is just a personal taste preference) 
* (Use rock salt (in a grinder is best) not just normal salt. It's a bit of effort, but worth it)

------



**Method**


* Slice your meat into long strips, along the grain of the meat. Mine are around 2 inches wide, but as long as they aren't too thick, the exact size/shape of each piece doesn't matter. Keep it under 4 inches thick to be safe (they can be as long as your biltong box is tall!)
* Make sure you do each step on BOTH sides of the meat, coating the entire piece very well
* Dust with a little bicarb soda, pepper and coriander (pepper and coriander seeds in a pepper mill works well) 
* Sprinkle on a GENEROUS amount of the salt mix, gently press it into the meat
* Pour brown vinegar over the meat, slowly (you want the salt mix to stay stuck on the meat, as best you can)
* Sprinkle a bit more salt mix on top, and put it in the fridge for 24-48 hours, in a sealed container (a big tupperware container is best)
* You can add a little more salt mix before hanging the meat, it won't be able to 'hold' much seasoning after it has dried.
* *note: it is fine to stack your marinading meat in layers, just make sure you put a little extra marinade &amp; salt between the layers*


* After the meat has marinaded, grab your S hooks and pierce one end of each strip of meat (about an inch from the end, make sure it fits in your box though)
Pour off any excess vinegar, and give the meat one more good sprinkle of your salt mix
* Put a bit of newspaper underneath where your box will be sitting, you may have a few small drips (a cool, dry place out of any direct sunlight is best)
* Hang up your meat in your biltong box. Put a fan next to the box, pointing directly at the meat. Make sure none of the pieces of meat are touching - they can be close together, but there needs to be a good amount of airflow to every surface of the meat when it dries
* Now turn your fan on and leave the meat to dry! Check it every day, just to make sure the fan is running, there's good airflow, and the meat is drying OK. Drying time really depends on how thick your slices of meat are, and the weather when it's drying. I make it in my garage year round, and we go below freezing in winter and over 45 degrees Celsius in summer.
* The meat will turn brown, shrink, and get a 'sheen' as it dries. Have a look at photos of dried biltong to get an idea, although the 'dryness' varies a LOT depending on taste preferences. My family prefers the meat very soft, so a shorter drying time, but I also enjoy the drier pieces - you can chew on it for hours that way! 
* When you think it is looking 'ready', take down the smallest piece and cut it in half. If it's still pink in the middle, its not ready. Put a bit more salt mix on the cut sides and hang it back up!!
* A good way to find your favourite 'dryness' is to take one piece down at a time, slice it up and see how you like it. Drier=chewier, harder meat. Wetter biltong is quite soft, almost like deli meat - whereas the driest type is like that rawhide treat or pigs ear your dog gnaws down on all day


* Once it is dried to your liking, take the meat down and store it in paper bags in the fridge. NEVER PLASTIC!! If the meat is softer, it can 'sweat' a bit and that will severely shorten the shelf life. You can vacuum seal it for longer term storage, and/or freeze it (it never lasts that long in my house)
* Slice the meat up (again, to your liking - but thinner slices are usually best) 
It's better to leave the pieces whole, until you want to eat them. We tend to slice one or two pieces of meat, and leave the rest whole until we've eaten the sliced bits.

NOW
 ENJOY YOUR TASTY TREATS

***VARIOUS NOTES/TIPS***


* Trim the fat off the meat BEFORE you marinade and dry it. You need every bit of the meat's 'surface' covered in the marinade and salt. It is extremely hard to trim the fat off once it's dried, especially the drier it is

* Marinade containers - My containers are old tupperware, any 'dish' shaped plastic container will do. If you have something for marinading meat, use that - just make sure its big enough for your pieces of meat to lie FLAT. You can stack layers of meat, and line them up like sardines, just make sure to cover every surface of the meat.

* Make sure none of the pieces of meat are touching when you hang it up. You want airflow on every surface of the meat.

* I use zinc plated ""Butcher's hooks"" from the hardware store. You want a thick, very sturdy S shaped hook with pointy ends (to pierce the meat) However, you can use a bit of sturdy wire instead (just bend it into shape) or any kind of S shaped hook, as long as it's strong enough to securely hang the meat

* You may have to make adjustments based on your climate/weather. But generally, you just want a draught/breeze (I use a box fan) and a location that is out of the sun, and protected from pests. 

* My 'biltong box' is simply a wooden frame, with a row of dowel rods at the top, and a hinged lid. Fly screen is stapled to the wood frame, enclosing the box. This will keep pests out, but still allow lots of airflow for the meat to dry. Once you've prepared your meat, you just hang the meat from the dowel rods with a S hook, put a fan right next to the box, and leave it to dry! 
If you would prefer to buy a biltong box, I would go for the ""Biltong King"" Biltong Maker, by Biltong Boks (about $125AUD, although they have a few 'kit' options with a slicer and/or seasonings)
https://www.biltongboks.com.au/products/biltong-king-biltong-maker

* You can add some other herbs/spices to the salt mix, just make sure you use those basic staple ingredients. I highly recommend sticking with the basic salt/coriander mix, at least for your first batch. It really lets the natural flavour of the meat come through, somewhat like having a good steak without any strong sauces 
(coriander is the only 'optional' ingredient - if you hate it, you can skip the coriander, but nothing else)

and check out r/biltong if you want some more ideas. The different methods can get a little confusing when you are just starting out though.

427,Mental Health Prep: What are you doing to make your quarantine more bearable?,"The premier of my state came out today and said extreme measures were inevitable (including school and university closures). What I saw as a distant possibility is looking more likely. I’ve got my food, my prescriptions, my cleaning supplies, etc - the only thing left is to make sure I’m okay mentally when it comes to quarantine. 

How are you all prepping for your MENTAL health during quarantine? 

Here’s what I’ve done so far: 

- bought a few 1000+ piece puzzles 
- bought a few board games for me and my roommates to play (uno, bananagrams) 
- bought some fun food (marshmallows, dark chocolate, edamame beans, etc) 
- dusted off my PlayStation 2 (including singstar)
- have a good cache of unread books 
- made a list of movies and tv shows I’d like to watch 
- stocked up on oil paints and canvases 
- began preserving fun vege jars (including rødkål - this is fun for me, idk) 
- bought a few indoor plants for the house

430,Looking for suggestions to add to my supplies,"I'm in the UK near London (where we have the most infections) and so in the event of a quarantine it's likely that my area will be included.

I live in a decent sized apartment with my girlfriend but no garage or massive storage space, and I'm contending with my gf not being thrilled about me spending £1,000 on prepping plus taking up all the room.

I have the following:

- 60,000 cal of survival biscuits with 5 year shelf life (1 months worth for two people if rationing) 

- 60,000 cal of MRE rations with 20 year shelf life (1 months worth for two people if rationing)

- Depending on how much of my order is delivered, approx 1 month to  2  months worth of non-perishable food for two people if rationing.

- 50 liters of purified water. 

- A life straw/bottle that filters 1,000 gallons of water. We have a large river 5 minutes away. 

- Enough painkillers/cough medicine/ antiseptic throat spray for maximum dose by two people for 1 month. Hard to get anymore with current availability. 

- 30 spare toilet rolls and 8 packs of wet wipes

- 4 bottles of anti bac surface cleaner

- 4 bottles of liquid soap (can't get more..out of stock everywhere)

- 6 bottles of bleach.

- 4 boxes of tissues

- 3 months worth of feminine hygiene products

- 2 large tubs of multivitamins


Anything missing? Bear in mind I am already close to maxing out available spare space and testing my girlfriend's patience. On rations its 4 months for food, water would run out within 1 month but that's why I have the life straw. I'm playing with the idea of getting protein powder to bulk put food and chlorine sachets for cleaning water.

I'm concerned about electricity but I have no room for a generator and batteries seem useless as almost everything is mains powered. 

My main other concern is home defence if the SHTP. In the UK we aren't permitted to own weapons for self defence and guns aren't an option. Our front door is heavy/solid and the only  other access to our apartment would be a ladder through the windows. I could get a high powered pellet gun but tbh I think that would just piss the attacker off and make them come back with friends. I have a few combat knives and I suppose I could get a bat...although I'd struggle to swing it in my hallway. We aren't even allowed pepper spray here...ridiculous.

- make cotton flannel wipes (the softest healthiest material), because it's cheaper than the store-bought stuff.

- repurpose an old plastic container for bird seed balls

- made a cotton fabric liner to fit that container (so I can just grab the lot of dirty wipes with the lining and chuck it in the wash), or just repurpose an old pillow case to fit a plastic dustbin.

- bought detergent spray that disinfects and deodorizes speciffically urine and dustbin smells (probably over the top, I'm quite squeamish about this new habit).

## Schools and facilities will close for 2 weeks in this 1-mile containment area in a New York City suburb

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said a containment area will be set up in the city of New Rochelle as Westchester County works to stop the spread of coronavirus. Schools and facilities within will be closed for two weeks, and the National Guard will deploy to this area to help support the community.

Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zuckersaid the area is a circle with a radius of about one mile.

Starting on Thursday, facilities and schools within the area will be closed for two weeks. The National Guard will help deliver food to homes and clean public spaces in the containment area, Cuomo said, describing the plan as a ""dramatic action.""

This will go on through March 25.

**“We’ll go in, we’ll clean the schools and assess the situation,"" Cuomo said. “This will be a period of disruption for the community.”**

 Cuomo described it as a “matter of life and death.”

New York is also setting up a satellite testing facility, partnering with Northwell Health, in New Rochelle, which is in Westchester County.

New Rochelle is “a particular problem,” Cuomo said, adding that “the numbers have been going up, the numbers continue to go up, the numbers are going up unabated.” 

Cuomo stressed the shutting facilities in the area is a ""dramatic action"" that applies to “large congregate facilities for gatherings,” including schools and temples, but not ""everything.""",PandemicPreps,1583861156,AccidentalDragon,31,1,True,2020-03-10 10:25:56,schools facilities close weeks mile containment area new york city suburb york gov andrew cuomo said containment area set city new rochelle westchester county works stop spread coronavirus schools facilities within closed two weeks national guard deploy area help support community commissioner dr howard zuckersaid area circle radius one mile thursday facilities schools within area closed two weeks national guard help deliver food homes clean public spaces containment area cuomo said describing plan dramatic action go march go clean schools assess situation cuomo said period disruption community cuomo described matter life death york also setting satellite testing facility partnering northwell health new rochelle westchester county rochelle particular problem cuomo said adding numbers going numbers continue go numbers going unabated stressed shutting facilities area dramatic action applies large congregate facilities gatherings including schools temples everything,school facil close week mile contain area new york citi suburb york gov andrew cuomo said contain area set citi new rochel westchest counti work stop spread coronaviru school facil within close two week nation guard deploy area help support commun commission dr howard zuckersaid area circl radiu one mile thursday facil school within area close two week nation guard help deliv food home clean public space contain area cuomo said describ plan dramat action go march go clean school assess situat cuomo said period disrupt commun cuomo describ matter life death york also set satellit test facil partner northwel health new rochel westchest counti rochel particular problem cuomo said ad number go number continu go number go unab stress shut facil area dramat action appli larg congreg facil gather includ school templ everyth

444,A stunning firsthand account of life inside the quarantined city of Wuhan. A reminder that life can grow and even flourish when you’d least expect it.,"WUHAN. It's roughly day 48 of the city's quarantine. We've been locked in our apartment complex for many weeks. I haven't eaten out since January 19. We're living in such strange times. 

After my last post, which was all about locks on doors and further restrictions, my husband asked me if I've posted any of the good. But...but... well, but nothing.  That convicted me.  

So from the epicenter of the coronavirus, here is just SOME of the good we have been experiencing because of the lockdown:  (Be warned - there is no way this post could be short.)

Our family life has never been better. Usually one weekend is long enough before I'm ready to send each of us back to school or work.  But for SEVEN weeks, we've been home together with very little outside influences or distraction, forced to reconnect with one another, learn how to communicate better, give each other space, slow down our pace, and be a stronger family than ever before.

We've learned how to accept help from others.  During this time, we've HAD to rely on others to show us how to get food and other things we need. People here are so good, and they want to help. It's satisfying to accept the help. 

Shopping is so much easier now. It comes straight to our complex, and we just pick it up.  Simple. 

Right now I hear birds outside my window (on the 25th floor).   I used to think there weren't really birds in Wuhan, because you rarely saw them and never heard them. I now know they were just muted and crowded out by the traffic and people. All day long now I hear birds singing. It stops me in my tracks to hear the sound of their wings.  

Spring in Wuhan is absolutely stunning.  God has been giving us glimpses of the beauty to come with near-perfect weather.  Because of lockdown, we get to watch spring slowly unfold right in front of us with no work, traffic, pollution, or other distractions.  I have pulled up my chair and am ready for the creator's show.  

My cooking has gotten way more creative. I'm cooking like a homesteader.  Housekeeping hasn't suffered, either. 

We take naps in the middle of the day sometimes.  

We've all been reading so much more than before.  

I've reconnected with lots of old friends. We've talked with our families more than ever before. 

We still work and do school, but all from home and all on flexible hours. It is not perfect, but it is fairly productive and good.  

We are exercising more.  Because we borrowed a rowing machine from school right before the lockdown, Edgar Franks has been rowing regularly at home and has lost several kilos already.  I still walk in the morning as usual, but I do so with no time restrictions and now with friend Erika Carlson. 

In my yoga world, I have finally done a forearm stand. I also share goofy yoga photos each day with a local friend/yogi.  This keeps us connected in spirit and movement. 

I could devote a whole post to the amazing community we've been blessed with because of this lockdown. We live near 4 other staff members, most of whom we didn't know well at all prior to this. Because of this quarantine, we have bonded with and supported each other in ways that I've never experienced in 9 years of living here.  (Crowd sourcing for feminine products and coffee, creatively sharing overstock of carrots and squash, etc)

Friday night, we four staff women celebrated Julia Marie Roehrkasse's birthday together.  We four have never before been together without husbands, kids, or larger community.  But that night, I felt like I won the lottery in the friendship department. Our gathering was genuine in a way that can only be shared by people who are experiencing the same thing at the same time and understand what each other are going through.  This bond we have may lessen when our world gets back to normal, but for now I wouldn't trade it for anything.  It is good. 

My prayer life has never been better and my study time has been much more real. I have quiet time that is actually (usually) quiet - and I can devote real time to it.  Most days I have so much more time to think, to listen, to process, and to discover.  I am discovering the good gifts that God has given me and my family. More than anything, I am bowled over by his goodness at every turn.  He overwhelms me with his goodness. 

We had ""church"" by Zoom this morning at 10:30, as usual. My husband just woke up from his nap.  My kid is reading quietly on the couch. I have the luxury of writing uncensored here on FB.  We are about to go pick up a ham that a friend is giving us, taking her our coffee and cranberries to share.  

God is providing so many opportunities for good while we are  here, and he is showing us his goodness every single moment.

We are at peace in the epicenter of the virus.  We are at peace in the epicenter of his will.  

Fear is a faithless coward and has no place in the lives of believers.  Fear and worry have no seat at our table. We're here because he wants us here, right now, for his purpose.

Coronavirus wants you to isolate and stock up and take care of your own first.  Instead, look to him first while you take care of others.  In community, we can do so much more than we can do on our own.   God is caring for us so richly and showering us with SO MUCH GOOD each and every moment. 

And the song just plays nonstop in my head - Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God.
It chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the 99. 
I couldn't earn it, I don't deserve it, still, You give Yourself away. Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God.

Psalm 118:6 - The Lord is with me; I will not be afraid.  What can man do to me? 

Pray.

452,Tip for people with limited N95 respirator,"So, I was only able to get ONE N95 respirator. We know that the re-use of a mask is not recommended. So, I decided to do some research to figure out ways I could re-use the mask safely since I have just one. Washing the mask is not recommended, as it greatly diminishes its efficacy and functioning.

I found that wearing a face shield ON TOP of the respirator protects it from direct contact with droplets/splashes and thus allows the mask to be reused.

[Source](http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=11637): *""However, the following steps would allow a person to reuse a disposable N95 respirator if necessary. A protective covering such as a medical mask or a clear plastic face shield should be worn over the respirator to protect it from surface contamination. The respirator should be carefully stored between uses, and the wearer should wash his hands before and after handling it and the device used to shield it. These steps are intended for reuse of a respirator by a single person.""*

Just got [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VXXUWK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) in the mail from Amazon today (still available) and wanted to share with others who may be in a similar situation. I can easily disinfect the plastic face shield after each use by spraying it with bleach/Lysol and letting it dry, then wiping it clean, ready for next use with the same N95 respirator.

Keep in mind, this process is only indicated for reuse among a SINGLE person. Of course, the sharing of masks between people is still a strict **NO**!

**Disclaimer**: I am not a medical expert, so please do your own research and exercise caution. Just wanted to share the information I found, and hope it will help others in same situation.

461,Felt Better After Visiting the Local Hospital,"Today I had to go to the local hospital to see my doctor for a quarterly checkup. Last Friday I had my blood drawn for a test at the hospital. I have been very leery going in but no cases locally so I just practiced distancing and hand sanitizer often. 

I was really impressed with what I saw vs. just a month ago. 

The nurse thanked me for using it and encouraged me to keep doing it. She suggested that my tetanus was overdue so I got a TDAP shot. 

When the doctor came in, we talked about my health. I started to ask him if I could get a Vitamin D test and he said that he included it in the test on Friday and that my number is 48 and is ok. I was surprised that he checked it proactively but then the subject of Covid-19 came up. I think he has to be getting his information information from some of the subs here because he was very knowledgeable about it and the treatments and the importance of Vitamin D in fighting it. He even pulled out the graph that shows why social distancing and other measures need to be taken. My doctor is proactively helping his patients and supports prepping!

Then I asked about the hospital and this is when it got interesting for anyone in a rural area: The hospital here has only two dozen beds and no ICU beds. When a patient needs ICU, they are transported to hospital 60 miles away. They are coming up with contingency plans to make makeshift ICU beds in the local hospital because in a full outbreak it's likely there won't be any ICU beds to send patients to. 

I'm sure there are a lot of rural hospitals in the same predicament.

466,Switzerland reaches 500 infected people. My workplace is stockpiling paper towel and hygienic products.,"So today we reached 500 infected people, Italy is in quarantine and ironically the border between Switzerland and Italy is still open. Worst, this border is in the Lombardi region, the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy.

It is right now possibly easier for a person in this region to come to Switzerland rather than going to Roma.

In Zurich the biggest city of Switzerland, pandemic warning posters were displayed everywhere in giant advertising screens. It was quite surreal experience to witness. 

At work we are in full preparation mode. A team started already home office this week and more are following. The company is providing computers and services to people who haven't the necessary equipment.

Some departments are sadly impossible to work from home, but we are trying to find solutions for those too like limiting outside exposure etc. 

Switzerland stopped testing non dangerous cases which is stupid because it's important to monitor and know how it spreads. Next week I anyway expect a big increase in cases.

I surprised a lot of coworkers because this weekend I said we would reach surely 500 cases and probably go over 1000 by the end of this week. They were quite astonished by how correct I was.

I couldn't verify it but apparently hospitals are preparing dedicated wards to threat those affected by the Coronavirus.

There is the same bullshit story about mask shouldn't be used if you aren't sick. At least they didn't said it was dangerous to use them. They said it is important for medical workers to have them.

468,Can we stop posting photos of other people on this sub?,"I'm very concerned about the increasing numbers of posts on this sub which are using photographs of people shopping at the store to shame them for prepping ""too much"". 

Firstly of all, why do you get to decide what is ""too much""? You don't know their situation. Perhaps they have a large family and need to prepare more food than you do. Perhaps they have an autoimmune disease or another illness which makes them more vulnerable, so they're scared and feel the need to prep more disinfectant/masks/hand gel than you do. Point is you have no idea what people's individual circumstances are, and you shouldn't publicly shame them for trying to look after themselves. 

Secondly, you are potentially endangering them. We don't yet know how this is all going to turn out - maybe (hopefully) the virus will mutate to a less deadly form and life will be back to normal in a few months. Or maybe it will sweep across the country, overwhelming our medical system and government response, causing food shortages and civil unrest. We have no idea, but since we're all here to prepare for the worst, why would you publicly post a picture of somebody stocking up on their preps? If SHTF, their face, preps and location will be on reddit for anybody to see. We need to look out for each other, not potentially make targets out of one another. 

Here are just a few examples of these kinds of posts:

If you're reading this and thinking, ""what's the big deal, it's perfectly legal to photograph people in public, nobody is going to track these people down from low quality phone pictures"", I'd say that sure it's legal, but in this instance I believe it is immoral. As another commenter on one of the linked posts above said, ""4chan has done more with less"". It's disturbingly easy to narrow down where most redditors live just from throwaway comments they make - they all add up to paint an overall picture of your location/identity.

Think about it: would you feel comfortable with somebody photographing you at the store with all your preps in your shopping trolley, and posting it online, without your consent? I honestly doubt that anybody in this sub would be happy about this.

I did a two week water fast (and didn't die!) 

The one thing I included in the water fast was ""snake juice"" which aided in muscle cramping &amp; fatigue which some people experience while doing these fasts

Here's what you'll need:

- Water = 2L

- Potassium chloride = 1 tsp (No Salt, Nusalt, etc.)

- Sodium Chloride = 1/2 tsp (Himalayan Pink Salt, Real Salt, etc.)

- Sodium Bicarbonate = 1tsp (Baking Soda - recommend no aluminum like Redmill Brand)

- *OPTIONAL* Magnesium Sulphate = 1/2 tsp (FOOD GRADE Epsom Salts

I sub out the optional Magnesium Sulphate for Magnesium Glycinate because if you've ever digested Epsom Salts you'll know it's highly likely coming out fast through the other end.

483,What I learned from being sick with a virus that had 11/14 symptoms in common with COVID19,"So I’ve been sick. I’m better now (thank god) but this was worse than the flu I had last year that I thought was the worst illness I’d ever had.

I went into my doctor who told me it was just “some virus” going around.

When I didn’t get better and was getting worse I got in touch with him again to ask about being screened for COVID19. His response “You don’t have coronavirus as you haven’t been on a cruise ship or been to an affected country.” 

I was sick with something that has 11/14 symptoms in common with covid. My community has CONFIRMED community spread. 

They have canceled all large events and I was still told this by my doctor and denied testing in the US. (Bay Area) I’ve never been denied a test before and have excellent insurance. 

So while I can’t say I had it at all. I did learn a lot about what to have on hand to treat a virus that shares similar symptoms.


1.	don’t expect you won’t get sick. Have a plan
2.	Have a hospital go bag ready in case you or a family member needs to be rushed to emergency. Bring your own PPE. I had to go in for a chest X-ray and even the hospital staff had minimal PPE. 
3.	Make sure things you’ll need are at an arms reach. Having a get well soon box is very handy. Especially true of water and medicines.
4.	My house fell apart. Laundry went undone, the house was trashed. Make sure you keep on top of household chores. 
5.	I couldn’t speak for 6 days. It made communicating really difficult. Having ice packs/popsicles on hand helped to soothe my throat. 
6.	Being sick is isolating. Unless you are super introverted it might be difficult for you to be alone.

491,"Okay, shame me like I am 5.","I was making a reference to Explain to Me Like I am 5, but also... do shame me like I am 5, meaning gently but firmly, if I need it.

As of this moment, three of my kids, ages 8-16, are scheduled to fly to Florida the first week of April, to spend spring break with their grandparents. They grew up less than an hour from their grandparents, and when we moved about a year and a half ago, hearts were broken on all sides. Last spring break, my in-laws paid to have the kids fly down to visit for spring break. Same thing this year. Plans were made MONTHS ago; you know- to get a decent price on flights. Hah. 

My kids are still expecting to fly down. Only the teen knows there is a good chance we will need to pull the plug. If we do, my partner and I will pay change fees and whatnot. Decision to be made probably this week, and my partner's opinion will weigh so heavily this thread might be moot anyway. 

To continue with the background: when I first gave my in-laws heads-up we might have to change plans, about a week or two ago, my mother-in-law very much gave the impression she felt I was overreacting. I stressed I am actually not worried about my kids, but that they will be a vector for spread. VERY specifically, I am worried about my in-laws with their age, and my father-in-law's lung health. My mother-in-law's response to that concern, paraphrased? ""He's tough. My sister is flying down next week. It isn't that big a deal."" 

I am thinking to tell the kids, don't eat, don't drink, hand sanitize before and after. I also have basic surgical masks I bought like two years ago I could stick on them. It is about a 2 hour direct flight.

They have not seen their grandparents since November. If the other grandkids local to them get them sick (actually fairly likely), this \*could\* be their last chance to see them. If all is well, they will see them over the summer.

I think I know what is right, but I am trying really hard to justify selfish choices. But maybe I am overthinking it? It is still like three weeks away, so might be overcome by events like us getting sick, anyway.

Okay, I am done. Thoughts? Also, bless you for reading or skimming through my brain dump.

With big news looming on all corners of the globe, this is your friendly reminder that *now is the time to be your very kindest*.

People don't think correctly when they're scared. They may be hostile, change tune within hours, or continue denying.

Be kind anyway. Shutting down conversations with matched hostility could mean the difference of life and death, if everyone else in their echo chamber is brushing it off.

Today I saw people who had been laughing off the whole situation post a few more sober articles and headlines.  I responded as kindly and helpfully as I could. 

Not gonna lie - it was difficult. I erased a few well humored, but snarky 'I told you so' comments in favor of 'this will affect our community, but we can slow it down if we prepare and cooperate with social distancing'.

I even saw a few, scared people reposting that famous Mr. Rogers quote about looking for helpers.  I felt proud to be a helper at that moment.

A kid at a school in my area got sick with coronavirus, (middle schooler), school got a ""deep clean"" then stayed open. 45 percent of the kids didn't show up the next day... parents it seems are not on board with  this schools procedure. Not sure if any kids are still out, but this was at the beginning of this week. Our health authority says schools should stay open since kids are low risk for it. They said ""days count"", that school is important. On a Nextdoor app, for those of you familiar with it, a person posted that this sick kid was on the bus and some other kids were experiencing symptoms and they couldn't get tested.. meanwhile the school stays open and very few people even know about this info...it certainly isn't on the local news. So many more kids could have it now and not have symptoms yet.. In my neighborhood full of kids they play together every day and the park is full daily in our neighborhood. My kids aren't allowed to play when other kids come to ask.  Meanwhile, my husband that has chf forgets to take the vitamins I give him everyday and I have to make sure. He says he has to go into the ""real world"" and sees people sick or coughing all over. So when I go to the store one person last night (a young girl, probably middle school age), coughed in front of me in line at the store and I only didn't walk away because I was in the return line at Fred Meyer..you can't return stuff any other way and it was bacon so I just stood there. I just was debating with myself telling myself I was overreacting, that I'm pretty worried about this virus, that I have been thinking about it a lot... Now I'm worried I'm going to get sick. Overreacting, some would say for sure. She coughed in her elbow and I was behind her, about six feet. But am I worried? For sure. I've been careful about everything but this situation across the world looks bleak. I saw pics of Italy today, holy shit. It's scary to see people sick like that. There aren't enough tests here. In my state finally large crowds over 250 are banned. This seems like it should have happened long ago. Schools should be closed now. We need to freeze mortgages like Italy.

Feeding the starter is an easy process of just adding more flour and water.

There are plenty of recipes out there, I won't plug one, but it's basically: mix equal parts flour and water and wait. Add some flour and water every day for a week or so.

Most recipes recommend whole wheat flour and/or rye, but I believe the last time I did it (n=1, so take with a grain of salt) I just used regular all-purpose flour.

524,Pulse Oximeter buying tip - pick one that has perfusion index,"Just wanted to share for those who are considering purchasing a pulse oximeter,  you may want to pick one with a perfusion index (PI) feature. They usually don't cost much more than pulse oximeters without it.   


&gt;Perfusion index is an indication of the pulse strength at the sensor site. The PI's values range from 0.02% for very weak pulse to 20% for extremely strong pulse. The perfusion index varies depending on patients, physiological conditions, and monitoring sites.   
 [https://www.hopkinsmedicalproducts.com/images/art/Pulse-Oximeter-Perfusion-Index-Info.pdf](https://www.hopkinsmedicalproducts.com/images/art/Pulse-Oximeter-Perfusion-Index-Info.pdf)   
  
&gt;  
&gt; The PI is useful for quickly evaluating the appropriateness of a monitoring site for pulse oximetry. A site with a high pulse amplitude (high PI number) generally indicates an optimal monitoring site for other pulse oximetry and Pulse CO-Oximetry measures. The fingertip is the standard monitoring site for pulse oximetry. The hand or foot (sometimes toe) is often used in neonatal patients. Surgical patients, however, are subject to unpredictable changes in peripheral perfusion, particularly with a large degree of variability in body temperature. Such changes in peripheral perfusion may have variable effects at different sensor locations. It is useful, therefore, to have an alternative to the standard fingertip sensor site.

I have been following the Coronavirus progress since late December. I’m in Arkansas, USA. Yesterday, 3/11, (I’ll always remember the date bc it was my fave band in high school) we had our first presumptive positive case. 

Today we have 6 presumptive positive cases. Literally half the states schools have shut down for an entire month (all announced today). My company has sent a memo to all employees that they may work from home until 3/27 if necessary. This is not a company that was comfortable with a WFH policy. 

All grocery stores are starting to look bare and the lines are long at check out (100 times worse than if there was a snow storm predicted). Everyone acts as if they are shocked. DO PEOPLE NOT PAY ATTENTION WHEN OTHER COUNTRIES ARE ON LOCK DOWN AND OLD FOLKS ARE DYING?  I’ve been prepping for 1.5 months, I’m fairly confident I can get away with 2 months for a family of 4.  I don’t think it will come to that.  My husband saw all of this (he’s been supportive) and said ‘you did good!’ 

I warned close family last night that it’s about to get REAL. Get some ramen noodles, something. They both told me not to live my life in fear. I kindly disagreed this was not fear for my or my family’s life but protecting the community. They. Did. not. Get. It.  I think they will pretty soon.

This is just the beginning. My sister told me she saw on Twitter an older lady crying because there was nothing to buy. This is especially horrid because wasn’t it two weeks ago when we saw the old Italian man crying because of THE SAME THING?

I cannot and will not risk my children’s security to help adults who did not get ready.  I am not a millionaire. After getting ready for this I am not even a thousandaire. We spent the money we had saved for medical bills ( because American) to get ready for this. I did not dip into a magic well of richness, I made a terrible calculation that put us into debt as that seemed less dangerous than not having the supplies to get through this. 

I have no idea when things will restock or what they will restock with or what will not restock for a very long time. And the danger will only get greater as we go forward. 

I told my sister I was going to shut down my social media soon because I cannot help everyone and that this is why I begged her to get ready ( she did, somewhat and is in a better position than many). 

I am depressed about this.  But I will not be able to function for the people that I can help if I am drowning in the pleas of people I can not.

People should have stocks of at least a month of medical and personal necessities even during everyday life. Then other times I just feel sad and want to help, seeing friends run out of tp and not be able to get groceries ALREADY is stressful when I’m doing just fine in those departments.

568,From this point on every day is going to unravel a bit more and more. Remain equanimous as you witness it all. Don't doubt the preparations you've made and don't criticize those who didn't have the gift of hindsight.,"I truly believe hindsight is a gift not all humans are wise enough to have. We are the lucky ones that could see the way this disaster could unfold. Have compassion for those who are still figuring things out. Lend a hand where you can, but ultimately know you made the decisions you have to look out for you and your own family. Things may get rough. People may knock on your door begging for help. You need to be ready to respond accordingly. Will you offer them your food? Will you play dumb? You may not know until the moment it happens. 

Now is the point at which the tsunami is becoming visible from the shore. People are beginning to realize the necessity of preparing as much as they can because the window is visibly closing in around them. 

Remember survivor's guilt is a real thing. You may see people around you suffer because they didn't have the hindsight to prepare. You may feel guilty that you could have helped them and you didn't. You may regret not warning your friends and loved ones more. Acknowledging this factor is an important step in prepping and coping. 

Prepping is not just about your physical belongings but your mental preparedness and well being. Things will change in ways none of us can understand yet, but we can recognize this factor and do our best to remain in the moment throughout it all as we experience it. 

You've done your part up until now. You've made it up to higher ground. Even if it's just a little above the water, every step is an important step that will make a difference for you and your family. 

I'm truly grateful for this subreddit. Thank you to the community we have built and continue to build together as we brace for this historical time. I know it will be a source of inspiration, determination and willpower in the days ahead. Stay strong everyone!

I’m hearing a story of a pregnant friend of mine who’s scared to go to the stores but also scared because she hasn’t stocked up. My Instagram is filling up with friends freaking out at empty shelves. Group texts are filling up asking where can people get toilet paper. I’ve never been in a situation that I felt was a true emergency but I felt like i just left one. The worst is ahead of us, but leaving the city last night felt scary. I thought about everyone who couldn’t leave-the elderly, the homeless, people who are still working.

578,Western PA Aldi Report (3/13 at Noon),"To start off, no confirmed cases here. Closest is on the other side of the state or in Ohio. We've been behind the curve in terms of shortages, but today, I started seeing some ""out of the ordinary"" things. It's not just TP and cleaning products now.

Local Aldi at noon on Friday:

* Typically wouldn't be busy at all, but you could barely navigate your cart. One side of the cart return didn't have any left. Tons of people in the store. They had 4 out of 5 checkout lines open when I've never seen this one with more than two open.
* Rice and dried beans were gone. This was very surprising. People don't normal buy these.
* Canned fruit gone except pineapples. Was going to grab another case of fruit cocktail. Not anymore.
* All the cheaper canned beans, gone. Only the twice as expensive organic ones were left.
* Obviously the toilet paper, tissue paper, paper towels, and (I think) paper plates were gone too.
* Bottled water was gone. Some fruit flavored bottled water was left, but getting picked over.
* Frozen chicken and meats were 95% gone. Chicken for sure. Some beef left. Non-frozen chicken was being picked over too, probably 50% gone (which isn't normal).
* Frozen boxed foods were picked over. Probably 25% left in the larger freezers on the ground level in the middle. These typically are your prepared meals and dinners, etc.
* I was surprised to see frozen fruit and vegetables still available. They were getting picked over. I mainly got stocked up on these items as that's where I'm missing in my dry foods department.

I really think that later tonight and definitely tomorrow when people are off work, store shelves will really be picked over. I just don't think they'll be able to keep up with demand on normal goods. People are going nuts on a Friday afternoon, the weekend will be a madhouse.

580,Partner said thank you to me for prepping. He gets it now.,"I started visiting this site in February almost daily and took all of your advice to prep. I had been reading the medical articles online and knew this wasn't ""just the flu bro"". 

We're not rich people but I would pick up a few extra things every time I went shopping. I stocked my fridge with fresh fruit and vegetables, stocked my freezer with meat and veg, premade sauces and stews, bought a ton of canned goods and non-perishables, and stocked up on cleaning supplies and household necessities. I don't have a car so I would have to lug it by myself or in my shopping cart. I started growing some veggies in water on the windowsill from cuttings (just this past week). 

About two weeks ago I got this strange feeling that things were going to get ugly quick, so I told my partner that we needed to go shopping. I just couldn't carry those heavy cans anymore. I just increased my shopping and picked up extras of everything including cleaning supplies and food. He never really said I was doing this unnecessarily, but he was skeptical. I could tell he wanted to mock me. He didn't think things would go bad. 

Two days ago it got real for him when they suspended the NBA. Yesterday, the schools in my area said they would close after March break. Today, universities and colleges are moving classes online. And yesterday, there were hour plus lines at grocery stores to purchase food. Toilet paper is sold out. Cleaning supplies are gone. 

We're not as well prepped as most of you because we can't afford much, but I've made sure we can last at least three to four weeks based on what I've bought, maybe longer with some smart cooking.  By then, I hope the panic will have subsided somewhat.

584,Financial prep - one of the most important preps of all,"Now we get to see what happens when a service economy crashes into a pandemic, and it's not going to be pretty.  I'm sure a lot of us remember what it was like in 2008/2009 when people stopped going on vacation, stopped flying, stopped going out to eat, etc ... except that was just because there was a financial crisis, not because people's lives were at risk.

Imagine what its going to be like now when so many people are in service jobs and independent restaurant owners, etc, across the country basically mothball their own businesses for a few months, and lay off many of their employees.  Many of those people have been living paycheck to paycheck, don't have any savings, and when they are out of work and there aren't any new jobs to be had, it's going to be tough.

It's a teachable moment.

I'd recommend the book ""The Richest Man in Babylon"" to anyone interested, because it talks about these very kinds of issues, about the importance of saving, of being prepared for the worst, and of making the most of the income that you have.  It's a book that was written in the 1920's and is one of the few practical books that is now in the public domain that you can still find on bookstore shelves anywhere in the United States.  It's also available for free online in PDF, .. there's even a Youtube audio version of it which I will link to below.

Having finances in order, and having some savings, is one of the most important preps .. because money can get you a lot of things when you most need them, and we can never be sure what the future holds.

To be frank I'm so proud, back in January when I talked to my partner about this I was afraid to be seen as panicking however we both agreed to start stockpiling long term food.  I wish I wasn't right but here we are.

Switzerland in general has a culture of prepping (there are bunkers everywhere) and I'm glad I'm in this country. Even at a national level we have 2 or 3 months for emergency reasons. This stockpile is stored by the food companies themselves and they are paid by the government for that.

600,Get spices and hot sauce.,"Much of our SHTF preps is bulk food like rice/lentils/beans/wheat. This is good. Calories for dayz. What is not good is eating the same bland dish for three days in a row. SPICES! Spices are the spice of life! Make the mundane extra ordinary. 

What comes to my mind is garlic, rosemary, cumin, various peppers, chili oil, soy sauce. What do you like? What would you use? Go nuts. 

Another addition I’d recommend is some HOT hot sauce. The gimmicky 1,000,000 scoville carolina reaper ghost pepper XXX explosion type of sauces are actually really useful. Dilute the very hot sauce into something and mix that into your food for something mild, palatable, and delightfully spicy. Dial it in to exactly how hot you want. One bottle can give a lot of mileage depending on how much you use. A couple of drops can be enough to spice up a meal for an average person. 

Capsaicin is euphoric and gives something to. If you are so inclined try the hot sauce straight up. Sweet mary is it painful.

601,Life on The Rock,"I’ve posted on here a few times for hints, tips and support. I’m so happy that I stumbled across this thread when I did and began prepping early. I’m still grabbing bits and pieces at the store that are non essentials and it is pandemonium. I doubt there are many people who live in Gibraltar that are on this thread so I thought I would share whats happening in our territory to those of you who are interested.

As I’ve mentioned before on here, Gibraltar is a peninsula which for those of you who don’t know, means we are surrounded by water on all sides bar one entry and exit road which borders Southern Spain. Approximately 30,000 inhabit our little territory with 10,000 people crossing the border to work every day. These include our doctors, nurses and cleaners for the hospital. We have one hospital and pretty much one main supermarket. Where I work 50% of the staff live in Spain and the rest of us live in Gibraltar. To put it into perspective of how small our territory is, we have an area of 2.6 sq miles. 

The rumors are that Spain will be on lockdown from today, which will cause a lot of disruption to our lives (as the virus has already done so to our friends in Italy and elsewhere across the globe). The shift here will be very difficult because 95% of our food comes through the border from Spain. The Attorney General has presented these figures in the past few months owing to our preparation for Brexit as we are an overseas UK territory. Our relationship with Spain at times is frictious owing to a long political history which right now is fueling the anxiety here for many of the locals. The main panic I am witnessing stems from the amplification of our geographical circumstances and inability to go elsewhere.

Life on the rock is changing very quickly and there’s only so much that we can do. For now we just need to wait it out, I guess, but I’m thankful that me and my partner prepared with many thanks and nods to the people in this thread providing lists and ideas for prepping.

610,In the beginning...,"I’m a hyper vigilant person and started prepping on January 15th (payday lol). I’m an Asian woman and received a lot of stares and comments in public. Thankfully I didn’t experience racism during this time. I live in Minnesota and we have this thing called “Minnesota Nice” lol. Anyway, a lot of cashiers assumed I was buying N95 masks and sending them to China (I’m not even Chinese and I don’t know anyone in China 😏). This was way before CDC said we shouldn’t wear masks and when there were sooo many videos of Chinese people getting arrested or kicked out in public for not wearing a mask. I was able to buy enough food,water, and supplies to last me 30 days on January 16th. Yep, the very next day.

It was difficult mentally and emotionally at the beginning because I couldn’t tell anyone about my worries or my preps. I mentioned the virus to my parents and they brushed it off because “America is so modern and clean unlike China. It would never happen here.” It. Would. Never. Happen. Here. They say. Oh but it did.

613,Ramen Ideas that I make at home,"We love ramen.  Well I do.  I’m sure everyone bought a pack or 20 or 40?

I wanted to share some ideas to make it less boring, maybe more filling too.
If anyone have other ideas please share.
Thanks 

Here is what I do:

1. Add chopped boiled egg ... cook ramen (keep broth) and when it’s done add the chopped egg.

2. As you cook the ramen... add scrambled eggs and as you pour, stir the pot so the egg won’t be a big clump.  Really scramble that egg.

If you feel adventurous .....
3. Sauté... chopped carrots or what ever veggies you like cook 3-5 mins to however you like add spices like salt, pepper, garlic etc.. then add the water I add extra to make it soupy... add ramen noodles and packet...cook to what the direction says or until you feel that it’s ready.  Taste the broth might need more seasonings or hot pepper flakes if you like spicy.  The last 2 mins add frozen peas.  Cook till peas are ready.

I have used celery, baby Bok Choy, frozen peas, carrots, onions, frozen green beans... I’d say what ever veggies you have.  I don’t give measurements because that can varies to each person.
I like to put Shiracha, Hot Oil, Tabasco, hot pepper flakes... not all at once.  😆
You can use 1 ramen or 4.  I usually use 3 packets or sometimes 2, but taste it.  As I’ve said I add extra water to get the soup.

Any questions let me know..

622,The Next Phase - Strong Reminder of Why You Should Not Talk About Your Preps," 

We've already started seeing articles and posts about people ""hoarding"". NYT featured one today about someone who stocked up on hand sanitizer to re-sell on Amazon and can't because of Amazon's new rules.

As supply chains are disrupted and shelves empty out. The anger at ""hoarders"", which becomes anger at anyone with resources will increase. This is the first phase in justifying what action an angry person may take later.

I see some folks on my social media bragging about how they prepped. Bad move. You are now the target of the anger online, the visits for polite requests later, and the known resource cache if people get desperate. 

At some point hoarders = preppers = anyone with something I want. 

Remember our society is a thin veneer of agreed-upon rules.  As Katrina proved, it only takes a few people to stop agreeing to follow those rules, or feel they have no other choice for problems to start.

We have enough preps to last us quite awhile. My dad came back today and and said everything was pretty normal at the Grocery store.

I checked the news this morning 22 new cases in Ontario today for a total of 101. The day before was 21 new cases for 79...then day before that was 19 new cases for 60. 

Things are starting to pick up. I go on Facebook and see my musician friends still plugging their gigs and people posting photos from the shows. Some people are still toting ""Stop panicking and go out! It's all media hype..."" I feel like we're Italy 2 weeks ago and that things are about to change.

But my friends and family man.... they just don't give a shit it seems. I'm talking to my good friend and he tells me he doesn't have much food, but he just bought a new stereo. I have been getting a bit testy with my wife (extremely rare) because she is subtly mocking me for the steps I've taken to make us safe. My mom has an auto immune disorder and is still going out and will not listen to me when I tell her to stay in.

I love them but... what is wrong with these people? Have they not seen the state Italy is in or the dead being put into incinerators in China? Why won't they stay inside and get their ass in gear? You can look out our window right now and there are 80% less people on the streets.

638,Ex-Coworker just got infected with COVID19. Need advice for potential quarantine.,"So an ex-coworker of mine has recently been tested positive for the virus. He was a person in a higher position than me (My Trainer) and I'm a little startled. Not only did I last see him a little over 2 weeks ago, but he also only lives a few blocks - roughly a 15 minute walk - from my place. He and I are on good terms and would drink together every so often. He's older than me by about 20 years, last specific date I saw him I believe was 27th of Feb when I left my job. 

Given the circumstances, I don't think I have the virus. I had a mild cold around the same time I left my job, and I, as well as my family don't seem to have any current symptoms. We'd like to get tested the moment we begin to show any symptoms, but that's another topic. 

I would like advice on the off chance I need to quarantine myself. Because apparently the toilet paper pandemic wasn't a meme, I need to go a to the other side of town to get some. Should I be on the lookout for any specific medications, supplies, or appliances? What kind of food should I buy?

647,"Wheat, the ultimate long term food prep","Thought I'd bring this into the discussion since the store shelves are clear and people are wondering WTF ... and that is that wheat is a really great long term prep for people who don't know much about it.  It's inexpensive, stores a long time, and is good eating when cooked into just about anything.

Wheat does require a little bit of processing, and that means you have to have a grain mill, basically a mill that turns wheat into flour.  There are a lot of varities of these mills around, from a lot of manufacturers, and they vary in performance but most will create a usable product without that much effort.

Wheat is sometimes marketed as ""wheat berries"", but in my experience when it is marketed and sold that way it is usually for a relatively small amount, not a 70 pound bag.  It typically comes in red and white, with red being for some purposes, and white being a higher gluton wheat used mostly in the baking of bread.  The flours from both can be mixed, and mixed with other ingredients, to create a variety of tasty mixtures.

Wheat is also very inexpensive, runs like 40 USD for 50lbs ...

But I forgot about hand sanitizer. I’ve been to at least 15 stores of various kinds over the past two days (and even more over the past week) and there’s nothing. 

I even went to a pet store and got a pro tip to go to a dollar store next door. They’d sell it to you if you asked discreetly, but only one. 

I made my way there but just as I got close a family darted across the lot and they were mumbling about the deal with the sanitizer so it sounded like word had leaked out to the neighborhood I was in. 

They basically bee lined to the register before I had a chance and were sold the last bottle. 

I was gutted. The bottle was a decent size, I tried to to see what it looked like online but the dollar store website didn’t list it. 

I went back out at 3:30 AM today to try and see if the 2 Walmart’s in my area had restocked but they haven’t. It’s now 5:17 AM and I’m leaving empty handed.

650,Biltong - marinading and hanging the meat,"Just finished hanging up this batch, there are some photos of the major steps in marinading and hanging it up

https://imgur.com/gallery/GtOQguF

---

Now for this batch, I got 3-4kg of topside from the butcher, cut WITH the grain of the meat. You can pick up a roast and slice it yourself, of course, just make sure you cut with the grain. If you prefer fatty meat, go with silverside - I hate the fat, so I always get topside. Some of the pieces are a bit bigger than I prefer, but we're vac-sealing some of it to take interstate - and it's much easier to vac seal one big piece than a bunch of smaller ones. The bigger pieces will take longer to dry than the smaller ones.

Just a quick refresher on the steps

* Mix up your salt/coriander/pepper/baking soda/brown sugar
* Brush the meat with a little brown vinegar
* Sprinkle the meat with your salt mix, you need to cover all the meat with a good amount of the salt mix
* Press the salt mix into the meat, gently
*Pour a bit more brown vingar on, flip the meat over. It should be coated in vinegar already (if not, pour a bit more on)
* Salt that side well, press it in. You can stack the meat in layers, just put a little bit extra salt in between the layers
* Cover your container(s) and put them in the fridge, for about 24-48 hours

----

After the meat has marinaded, check each piece - if it's turned a light brown colour, its ready to hang up. If there are any red pieces, give them a bit more salt and marinade longer in the fridge. After another 5-6hours in the fridge, mine were ready to hang up with the rest.

Hang your meat up in your biltong box (or any cool area that doesn't get direct sunlight) Put a bit of newspaper down as you can get a few drips. Put a fan next to the biltong, and make sure there is some airflow around each piece of meat (you don't want any pieces to touch, try and spread them out)

-----

And that's it for now! Depending on how thinly you sliced your meat, and your climate, it could be a few days up to a week or two. The meat will darken until it's almost black, and it will have a slight sheen. If you slice a piece open, it should be brown all the way through - if it's still red in the middle it's not ready - salt the edges you just cut, and hang it back up. I'll put up some more photos when this batch is done, and show you how to store it.

653,Your Predictions: What Are the Next Supplies to Run Low?,"In my town, stores are entirely cleared out of: toilet paper, hand sanitizer, paper towels, general cleaning supplies (e.g. multi-purpose spray cleaners), gloves, rubbing alcohol, dry powder milk, instant noodles, dry beans, brown rice, cough medicine, whole wheat flour

Stores have very, very little stock of the following: Tylenol/acetaminophen (adult and children's), pasta, tomato sauce, canned beans, white rice, bottled water

You can still find the following, but stock is limited or there is less selection: pasta sauce, canned veggies and fruits, shelf-stable meat products (e.g. Spam, canned chicken and tuna), disposable diapers

(This was as of the afternoon of Thursday, March 12 - we started staying home that evening. So thankful we skipped the horror that's happening this weekend.)

I'm trying to stay one step ahead. 

For example, this week, I stocked up on random little activities like stickers, paint sets, and anything Frozen-related to keep my child busy so my husband can continue to work (from home) and I have a few tricks up my sleeve to save my sanity. Sure enough, yesterday it was announced that public schools are closed for the next month. I expect our daycare will follow suit shortly (and we may pull our child from care even if they don't).

656,Natural disasters can occur at the same time as this pandemic...,"It’s quite funny because me and my fiancé live in Los Angeles county, and we’ve actually talked a LOT in the past about getting some basic supplies for the inevitable next “Big one” that’s going to hit California. I unfortunately waited I think a little too long. When i first started hearing about people hoarding the toilet paper and water, I thought, “hmm, I should probably get some.” After witnessing firsthand the insane lines going into Costco and frantic nature of everyone else in every other store I realized this is much bigger than I originally thought.

The really daunting realization I had was that if there was an earthquake at the same time as this virus spreads, how absolutely catastrophic it would be. If the gas lines broke, electricity went out, and water lines broke, everyone in this massive concrete jungle would revert to a reeeaally primal state. Theft, violence, robbery, etc would likely become the natural actions of those who haven’t prepared, as hundreds if not thousands of people would immediately be placed in a life or death situation. 

I realized that the “oh, they’re out of water and TP? Well the supply chains are still intact so I’ll just come back later. It’s all good” was not a very good way of thinking. I work nights, so during the latter half of last week I popped into stores soon after they opened and started gathering what I could. It was amazing how busy the stores were, but they were still fairly well stocked and i got what I needed. We have enough to last us probably a month, which probably isn’t enough, but it’s a start. 

I don’t believe in hoarding, but i do believe in being prepared for whatever situation could arise. And I had to be honest with myself that we were not prepared for this, and especially if a big earthquake or some other natural disaster were to cut supply lines or damage stores, amidst this coronavirus outbreak, we’d really be fucked. 

So my friends, remember that earthquakes, fires, tornadoes, blizzards, and hurricanes don’t just stop happening because of a coronavirus outbreak. The way this year is going, it’s probably wise to prepare for the worst. If you’ve been wise like I was not, you’d already have a decent stockpile of water, canned goods, TP, first aid (rubbing alcohol and sanitizer) - all the stuff that people are frantically buying now - before this virus even broke out.

659,Did You Know That We Are Selfish Jerks Who Are Lowering the Health and Sanitation Standards for Everyone Else?,"So I have noticed an increasing trend of blaming preppers for hoarding toilet paper. The more mild posts make fun of anyone buying large quantities suggesting that they need more fiber in their diet. 

But lately there has been an uptick in posts explicitly blaming preppers for actually helping spread the disease or causing hardship to their fellow citizens. I have seen a picture going around of a frail old lady trying to reach the last box of TP on a high shelf and now these comments:

&gt;Depriving others of hygiene supplies will assist the spread of the virus within your community. Hoarders are actually making their living circumstances more dangerous by artificially creating a lower standard of sanitation amongst others in their community. (https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/fiy2ch/vitamins_dont_actually_boost_your_immune_system/fkjvh54/)

&gt; Same. Each and every one of them deserves some kind of punishment for this kind of fearmongering behaviour. Fear breeds fear and everyone in this video is responsible for making it worse. Some kind of punishment should be waiting for people like this. No excuse for this level of stupidity. As an aussie i have never felt less proud of my country than seeing this shit https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/fizywx/toilet_paper_war_at_aldi_in_australia/fkk7fwf/

And so on. The point is people need a scapegoat especially the worse things get, and they are going to get worse. No one sees the fact that by stockpiling it allows people to self isolate and keep themselves and others safe. They want to vent their anger and they will be looking at preppers to blame.

670,Parents refuse to put on masks,"
We bought some FFP3 masks before this SHTF. I also bought a 3m halfmask and asked them whether they would want me to order it for them as well. They said, like all the drones in society, ''well no we won't need it''. I knew that those ffp3 masks would be difficult to wear for a prolonged time. Still they didn't listen. 

Now that there are already lots of infected in our city. I ask them to wear the ffp3 masks. My dad listens because he is way more worried. Parents are in their late 40's so its normal they have to be more careful. Now the problem is my mother. She is so so stubborn. She has breathing problems. Thats why I told her before to buy the halfmasks but no.. she refused. 

She doesn't even WANT to wear any masks going outside! Now what good will it do if my dad wears the mask but later at home she infects him. 
She gives me the argument well if I am going to wear I only wear the surgical masks because everybody is also wearing it. And if she goes outside that my little sister will be wearing it too. Everyone KNOWS here that those surgical masks do not do ANYTHING to protect! 

I am at a point where I just want to give up. All the prepping i've been doing I just want to throw all away because what good will it do if my family gets infected.

681,Pantry prep for one on tiny apartment in Spain,"Hi yall! I live in a big city in Spain, officially in state of alert since this morning so people are only allow to leave their homes for main necessities (buy food, medicine, work).

I made 2-3 big grocery runs last week when we started to have coronavirus cases in the doble digits in the country. When I say big I mean as much as I can carry walking because I don't have a car and I've seen people in this subreddit filling massive trucks in one go

 I always has been into the prep thing but never had the space for it or the money for big investments, so I hope I covered my basics, all kind of food stores and delivery services are now confirmed to stay open so if this lock down keeps going I don't have the fear of actually running out of food. Still I don't plan to leave the house for at least 3 weeks unless I get sick.

Please leave me your opinion as I always like to know others think, and this is the first time I have to do something like this!

683,Looking for Work Advice (Canada),"Hi Reddit! I’m new to posting, so please take it easy on me if I’m rusty with the etiquette. 

I’m in Ontario, Canada, and work as a bartender/server at a high volume restaurant/nightclub. I’m also considered a “high risk” individual with a pretty poor immune system since birth, despite my efforts to improve it. (If my coworkers have a sniffle, I’m the one to catch it and be off work for a week.)

In addition to my own health concerns, the other two people in my household are even more high risk, with age and underlying health problems being contributing factors. 

We prepped a few weeks ago and would be ready to quarantine at a moments notice, so I’m feeling good about that. 

The problem is - most people here are still going about their daily lives like nothing has changed. The stores have gotten busier from what I’ve heard (I’ve had a cold and haven’t been out since Tuesday), but the majority of people are still going out to bars, the mall etc. As of today, we have no confirmed cases in our city, but we are also not testing unless there is travel history or known exposure. 

I want to tell my boss that I will be taking time off, it’s not worth the risk to myself or my family if I bring germs home. He is one of these people who doesn’t see the severity in this outbreak. Tuesday is St. Patrick’s Day, usually one of our busiest days of the year. I’m terrified to work. 

How should I go about this? Am I able to take the Ontario EI self isolation leave for 14 days if I’m self isolating without illness/exposure? I really need to come back to this job (can’t really afford to leave it now either, but that’s unavoidable).

697,Family And Friends Are Opening Their Eyes To Prepping,"I was never a prepper before any of this started. I didn’t start stocking my pantry up until about two weeks ago, the first time I realized that quarantine is a very real possibility. I feel ashamed that I was blind to what was going on, but at least I’m ready now. I have plenty of food/meds/water for me, my 1yo daughter, and our dog. There was still plenty on the shelves at the store while I was preparing my little family. 

I’m the sous chef at a restaurant staffed with mostly people in their teens and 20s. These kids are not taking this seriously. It’s either all a conspiracy, or it’s just the flu to them. You can’t bring up the idea of prepping without being shit on, so I quickly learned to keep it to myself. 

People are opening their eyes fast now. My mom has stocked up on food finally for herself. She is a healthcare worker, so she has always been very stocked on medicine and cleaning supplies, which she very generously shared with me. I made sure to have extra food for her in case she runs out. 

My boyfriend today even saw the light. We don’t live together, but he comes over on weekends to spend time with me and our daughter. He sat in the car with her while I went into the store to do my last stock up of baby food. 

As I was putting on my mask and gloves, has pulls out his wallet and slips me his card and asks me to help him prepare. I grabbed pasta, sauce, soup, canned veggies, beans, crackers etc. for him. Selections are so limited, it’s scary, but better late than never. He called me later to tell me he went to two more stores after getting home to stock up on some meds and more food. He even managed to find toilet paper and Lysol wipes at a random dollar store. 

Be confident in your preps, and be there for your friends and family if they are scared or feeling lost. It was a shock to me when my bf finally realized that this shit is real and it isn’t just “something that happens every election year.” We have 3 confirmed cases in our city now, 2 of them are community spread.

699,Should I stay at my parent's house or return to my studio apartment?,"Hi all, I've been following this sub for the past month or two and have found it super helpful. This is only semi-related but I would value your opinions.

I'm currently a grad student at my parent's house, which is a suburb of a minor city (America). I go to school in a large city about two hours away in the same state and have a studio apartment there. I've got 2-3 weeks worth of food and 2 months of cleaning/hygiene supplies there (it's harder to estimate how well stocked my parent's house is but I would put it at about the same, maybe slightly more food). I left all my textbooks there so I will have to return at least temporarily to pick them up. However, I'm not sure which city I should remain in, in a minor city with my family of five or in a large city by myself. 

Lastly, I'm primarily worried about travel bans applying to in-state travel. Obviously it's a crapshoot, but how strongly do you guys foresee states shutting down in-state travel and quarantining people in their cities?

I'm sure some other people are in similar situations trying to decide where to remain.

I was tempted to ignore it, but coming here made me feel like I wasn’t the only one seeing how dangerous this was to our society and way of life. 

I’m the only person I know that prepared for this in advance, and I’m so glad I did. I have anxiety and knowing that I have several months of supplies, for myself and my family, has definitely helped ease my mind during this stressful time.

Or just filled the pantry with junk food, which is expensive. The next few months are not going to be kind to them.

710,Hello from Belgium! PandemicPrepsProTip: Restaurant Supply Stores Are Lifesavers!,"Bonjour from Belgium! Long time lurker and this is my first post on this sub. Firstly, a VERY HEARTFELT AND GRATEFUL THANK YOU to everyone here for ALL the lifesaving tips and suggestions. Here in Belgium the panic buying started last Friday, March 13th. I've been prepping for the past couple of months, not hoarding but just buying a little (or a lot) extra each time I went grocery shopping. But I still needed to pick up some extra stuff before the govt here puts us in total lockdown (which will probably happen within the next few days). 

I read on this sub about wholesale restaurant supply stores so I did some research and discovered one 5 minutes away from home. I arrived there at 07:00 this morning at opening time. OMG I WAS THE ONLY CUSTOMER. No crowds, no queues. I was able to shop in perfect peace and quiet almost all by myself for a whole hour while I loaded up on all the extras: cooking oils, tinned everything you could think, fresh fruits, fresh veggies, cheese, industrial disinfecting cleaning supplies, and PLENTY OF TOILET PAPER! 

I was there for an hour and I saw maybe 3-4 other customers max?! Unbelievable. If there exists a ""pandemic prep shopper heaven"" then I think I just discovered it today: my local restaurant supply store.  I very nearly cried tears of joy and relief in the store but managed to keep my composure. But not gonna lie: I wept tears of joy alllllllllll the way back home. 

I will most definitely return to that restaurant supply warehouse in the next few days to ""top off"" our supply before the lockdown goes into force.  And no, I will not tell a single soul about this place! Except for ALL YOU GUYS here!

You cannot go get tested for Covid19 at any hospitals or clinics, they told us we can call our emergency health line (811) to schedual a test at home. When you call they basically have a pre-recorded message saying the lines are flooded and to call again later.

Should medical devices and instruments be a part of the prep plan? If so, what all are mandatory...or good to have?

Pulse Oximeter, BP and Blood sugar machines?

Sterile gloves and respirators?

Some IV bags of dextrose and electrolyte. IV line set? 

Oxygen cylinders. Or an oxygen concentrator ?(if that is available for open sale in your area)

Some post here stated that ventilaors are in short supply in hospitals. Not sure if one can operate them in times of need without a nurse or a medical assistant?

Words of Comfort From My 92 Year Old Mother

Tonight, my mother and I discussed what we know about the Coronavirus. We are both considered to be at risk of having complications if we contract the disease. I have been worried about it, but what she told me tonight gave me some comfort. This is what she told me.

""It is ok to be afraid of what you don't know. But you can't let that fear take over your life. My generation and those that are older have been through this before. My earliest memory is of hearing Mommie and Poppie talking about the TB epidemic in our community. Mommie would scrub and keep everything as clean as she could. We avoided big crowds, only ate food that we prepared and never drank after or hugged anybody. I think every family on Fines Creek had a family member that died of TB or had someone that was quarantined. We just lived our life the best that we could, and took care of the sick. We always showed others that we loved.

I guess the next big outbreak was the measles outbreak when I was 7 or 8. That was a sad time. There were lots of young pregnant women that didn't make it. Homes had quarantine signs beside the door. People would still go visit but they would stand outside. People would prepare food and take to their quarantined neighbors. You showed people that you loved them, no matter who they were.

Then, there was the polio epidemic. Travel was restricted in some areas, and schools were closed. It was heartbreaking to hear of the young children that came down with polio. Your cousin, Juanita, had a bad case of it. We all pitched in and helped as much as we could. Whole areas were quarantined back then because of polio. We all worked together and showed people that we cared.

We made it through all those outbreaks, and we will make it through this one. We might lose people that we love. I did and everybody else did. It taught us that you have to live each day like it is your last one. Show people that you love them. Those lessons got us through the worst epidemic of all, WW11. We lost a lot of loved ones during that one.

It will be alright. Just live and love and you will have no regrets to be worried about. There is no place for hate or anger in a time like this. Show people that you care, no matter who they are.",PandemicPreps,1584382813,ker95,5,1,True,2020-03-16 11:20:13,facebook sorry posted relative since helped bit perhaps help permitted subreddit apologize trust mod delete dean rathbone comfort year old mother mother discussed know coronavirus considered risk complications contract disease worried told tonight gave comfort told ok afraid know let fear take life generation older earliest memory hearing mommie poppie talking tb epidemic community mommie would scrub keep everything clean could avoided big crowds ate food prepared never drank hugged anybody think every family fines creek family member died tb someone quarantined lived life best could took care sick always showed others loved guess next big outbreak measles outbreak sad time lots young pregnant women make homes quarantine signs beside door people would still go visit would stand outside people would prepare food take quarantined neighbors showed people loved matter polio epidemic travel restricted areas schools closed heartbreaking hear young children came polio cousin juanita bad case pitched helped much could whole areas quarantined back polio worked together showed people cared made outbreaks make one might lose people love everybody else taught us live day like last one show people love lessons got us worst epidemic ww lost lot loved ones one alright live love regrets worried place hate anger time like show people care matter,facebook sorri post rel sinc help bit perhap help permit subreddit apolog trust mod delet dean rathbon comfort year old mother mother discuss know coronaviru consid risk complic contract diseas worri told tonight gave comfort told ok afraid know let fear take life gener older earliest memori hear mommi poppi talk tb epidem commun mommi would scrub keep everyth clean could avoid big crowd ate food prepar never drank hug anybodi think everi famili fine creek famili member die tb someon quarantin live life best could took care sick alway show other love guess next big outbreak measl outbreak sad time lot young pregnant women make home quarantin sign besid door peopl would still go visit would stand outsid peopl would prepar food take quarantin neighbor show peopl love matter polio epidem travel restrict area school close heartbreak hear young children came polio cousin juanita bad case pitch help much could whole area quarantin back polio work togeth show peopl care made outbreak make one might lose peopl love everybodi els taught us live day like last one show peopl love lesson got us worst epidem ww lost lot love one one alright live love regret worri place hate anger time like show peopl care matter

I also notice about a dozen first time firearm buyers while I was in there.

742,Prepping in Home w/ Normies,"By normies I mean those who don’t consider this quarantine to be serious; those who don’t prep and are willingly oblivious to any warning about the virus. 

I live in rural Kentucky and only in this past day or two have items started flying off the shelves. Because I live in a house with Normies I’ve had to hide my rations. It’s made preparation extremely difficult, and I’m scared my family will raid my supplies because my mother has already told my siblings about the few cans I got caught smuggling in the house. With Governer Beshear basically putting the state on lockdown my family is starting to freak and have realized there is nothing to buy. I feel the need to hide my supplies again - thoughts?

So far I have accumulated the following.
Please give me an estimate of how long you think these supplies will last me. I’m 5’8”, 200 pounds and my daily caloric intake is somewhere about 1800 calories.

10 lb bag of white rice
2 boxes of chicken ramen
6 gallons of water
1 bag of beef jerky
4 cans of green beans
4 cans of corn
4 cans of black beans
4 cans of garbanzo beans
4 cans red beans
4 cans Spam
4 cans chicken
4 cans chicken noodle soup
2 cans tomato bisque soup
1 jar of peanut butter
1 jar of popcorn
4 boxes of Mac and cheese
1 box carnation instant breakfast drink
1 jar of Gatorade frost powder
1 bottle of hidden valley ranch :) 
1 box of gloves
1 box of medical masks (if you need one HMU )
1 jar of multivitamins 
1 jar vitamin C
1 jar vitamin b 12
2 bottles of guafinesin/expectorant (sp? Idk sorry)
2 boxes of Benadryl


I started my garden a little bit ago because I was keeping up with the spread of COVID-19 in eastern countries and saw how life-altering quarantine was for them. I am scared that the supply chain will be impacted through the summer. Because of this premonition I’ve started growing corn, potatoes, green beans, watermelon, summer squash, broccoli, tomatoes, carrots, garlic, sweet peppers, zenias, wildflowers, and cucumbers. (Posted in r/vegetablegardening)

748,Daily Thread - 3/17/20 - What are you doing to prepare today? How are you feeling? Any news/updates to share? (Plus A St. Paddy's Day blessing!),"Hey everyone. Heavy couple days all around. 

I know the majority of the people here were able to prep food, and necessities, but even so, there's only so much you can do to prepare for a lay off, or trip to the hospital for a loved one.

Just wanted to say this community believes in you - to be resourceful, to provide for and protect your family, to make the best out of every situation, and to be a helper in dark times.

It's St Patrick's Day, and if you're familiar with that famous monk at all, he had a pretty incredible, and difficult life. He drew his strength from God and never stopped sharing his good news.

So I thought I'd share a couple quotes I found of his that seem relevant to the times:

*If I have any worth, it is to live my life for God so as to teach these people's, even though some of them may look down on me.*

*Be still and know that I am God.
Be still and know that I am.
Be still and know.
Be still.
Be.*


And a simple Irish blessing to follow:

May your pockets be heavy, may your heart be light. may good luck pursue you every morning and night.

if you are the victim of domestic abuse NOW is the time to go to the courts, get a no contact order, leave town if possible, or make plans to stay with a friend.


I was reading somewhere that domestic violence situations in Wuham were escalated when the lock down occurred because suspects knew their victims couldn't leave town, and knew they couldn't leave their home.

This may sound alarmist, or like some type of privilege check because I know how hard it can be to leave a bad situation, or talk to law enforcement, but this is a call to action - if you do not have anyone unhealthy in your life, please advise your friends and family as well.

I couldn't live with myself if someone got hurt and I didn't put this advice out, so please double down on efforts to keep dangerous people out of your life!


The national domestic abuse hotline is 800 799 7233.

761,What's really happening in grocery stores - Rural Western Canada,"Hey all, I'm a front end supervisor at a grocery store in a rural-ish area of Alberta.  Here's what's going on for us.

We are completely picked over in terms of (obviously) toilet paper and paper towel.  We are also out of flour, sugar, yeast, 90% of our canned goods, instant gravy and soup packets, cereals and crackers, oats, cornmeal, fresh and frozen meat, frozen vegetables, and we are getting shorted about 50% on our orders of fresh produce.  We are out of eggs and milk and do not know when we will be able to get more at this point.

In terms of the supply chain, we are placing orders for vast quantities of restocks in hopes of getting even a small amount.  We are told that the trucks are no longer running as previously scheduled, due to the volume of orders coming in.  While normally we would do about 3-4 orders per department per week, we are now doing 1-2 orders per department per day, and receiving very little of it, if any of what is ordered. 

We used to be able to say that yes, Tuesdays at 730am we get delivery of X, but now it is entirely up in the air.  If the truck shows up, it is always at least 6-8 hours late.  Sometimes, we just don't get that delivery at all.  

We are still getting things in, albeit at a trickle rather than our regular stock rate.  I'm hopeful that if the panic buying stops, we will be able to be back to pretty much fully stocked again in about a 1-2 week time period.

768,Unsettled,"I am a graduate student in biology who intends to pursue clinical care and research in infectious disease, so the outbreak in Wuhan immediately piqued my interest mid-January. As I began following the spread of and response to covid19, I quickly realized that it would prove a sizable threat and, eventually, reach my mid-sized college town. That day came (officially) last week. That being said, I am so grateful to this other covid-dedicated groups scattered about reddit. You all kept me up to date on news of the outbreak when mainstream media disregarded it as fluff, you directed me to primary research publications so that I would not have to waste precious time searching library databases for sources, and, most importantly, you underscored the importance of preparing accordingly and guided me on how to do so. It wasn't cheap – especially on a slim graduate stipend– but I now have sufficient supplies to see me through the remainder of my time here and can focus on completing my research and thesis without having to frantically scramble about in crowds. I cannot thank you enough. Because of you all, I was able to purchase a little extra for my family and instruct them on how to get the house in order for an extended period of self-isolation. It took time, and some are still in a state of self-protective denial, but fortunately some have caught on and began making their own preparations. If it were not for you all, I would not have known how to best convey the gravity of the situation and provide tips on what purchases would be most pressing and prudent. However, despite having what I need, I cannot help but feel deeply unsettled. A great majority of  ""worst-case scenarios"" I envisioned or heard discussed on covid threads have come to pass. Granted, some of these developments arrived quicker than expected and others took more time, but they still happened. My gut has been nearly spot on for every preparation I made which I find greatly unsettling. Knowing that in all likelihood infrastructures will continue to buckle under the strain, I look ahead and see things which I cannot singlehandedly mitigate for myself and my community, and that is heart-wrenching. We, and other threads, have been for the most part spot-on with our expectations and preparations; I hate to be a '*doomer*', but everything in my gut is shouting that we are about to realize how easy our lives have been up to this point.

Even saw a woman leave with an infant in a carrier. 

It was so surreal that aside from a sweet little elderly lady also wearing disposable gloves I seemed like the only one even remotely aware of what is going on in the world. We’ve had over a dozen confirmed cases in my county so it’s not like people haven’t heard.

I was 19 then, I’m 37 now. My goodness, I’ve grown and learned a lot since then, but it is disconcerting and uncomfortable to me how similar my reaction is now as it was then... literally having a hard time tuning it out!  I’ve done everything I need to to prepare, been ahead of the curve.  I think it’s worse now, because of social media and all the sources available.

791,Why prepping is beneficial for even those who failed to prep. Alternatively- Thank you to this subreddit,"Hello all,

I live in the southern US and work in a grocery store. I’ve always been keen to keep an eye out for worldly events, but even in the beginning around early January I just thought of Coronavirus as some far off abstraction. 

Well here we are, middle of March and I am 7 days into self isolation. Why? I am certain I currently have the virus. 

Now, it wasn’t my plan, obviously, when I started prepping around a month and a half ago. My thought was that my stores would be used to bug in and avoid the chaos and try to delay infection. 

I’m offering a different perspective here, of how prepping (not hoarding) isn’t some crazy end of the world conspiracy theory thing to do. I remember as I was stocking up on pet food and supplies, extra flu meds, sports drinks and sanitizing supplies I was met with criticism from my wife. Not in any harsh way, just the now standard, “it’s not that big of a deal” changing into “We’ll just be careful and wash our hands” to finally appreciation. 

But guess who **doesn’t** need to leave the house for any reason what so ever for AT LEAST multiple weeks due to low supplies? Me. Guess who doesn’t have to worry (as much) about lack of pay due to missing work when it comes time to grocery shop? Me- because I was prepared. I got a sensible supply of TP before this chaos finally descended into the US. I have stored food, fresh and non perishable. 

In my opinion, there will be at least dozens, if not hundreds, of cases where spread of COVID-19 could be prevented due to people simply venturing out for basic essential supplies. They can self isolate all they want and be responsible hand washers, but what happens when you run out of food? You HAVE to leave. Grocery delivery availability is weeks out by this point. 

So, thank you to this sub. Even though I am pretty sick and not able to get sick leave (as of today) things aren’t quite as bad as they could be. If I hadn’t found this sub and followed some of yalls advice I could be responsible for getting many other people sick, or even killed. 

Prepping is a net benefit not only to myself, but to those around me as well. Try to look at it in those terms if you end up like me and come down with the virus anyways, as a little peace of mind.",PandemicPreps,1584549648,UnluckyWar5,8,1,True,2020-03-18 09:40:48,hello live southern us work grocery store always keen keep eye worldly events even beginning around early january thought coronavirus far abstraction middle march days self isolation certain currently virus plan obviously started prepping around month half ago thought stores would used bug avoid chaos try delay infection offering different perspective prepping hoarding crazy end world conspiracy theory thing remember stocking pet food supplies extra flu meds sports drinks sanitizing supplies met criticism wife harsh way standard big deal changing careful wash hands finally appreciation guess need leave house reason ever least multiple weeks due low supplies guess worry much lack pay due missing work comes time grocery shop prepared got sensible supply tp chaos finally descended us stored food fresh non perishable opinion least dozens hundreds cases spread covid could prevented due people simply venturing basic essential supplies self isolate want responsible hand washers happens run food leave grocery delivery availability weeks point thank sub even though pretty sick able get sick leave today things quite bad could found sub followed yalls advice could responsible getting many people sick even killed net benefit around well try look terms end like come virus anyways little peace mind,hello live southern us work groceri store alway keen keep eye worldli event even begin around earli januari thought coronaviru far abstract middl march day self isol certain current viru plan obvious start prep around month half ago thought store would use bug avoid chao tri delay infect offer differ perspect prep hoard crazi end world conspiraci theori thing rememb stock pet food suppli extra flu med sport drink sanit suppli met critic wife harsh way standard big deal chang care wash hand final appreci guess need leav hous reason ever least multipl week due low suppli guess worri much lack pay due miss work come time groceri shop prepar got sensibl suppli tp chao final descend us store food fresh non perish opinion least dozen hundr case spread covid could prevent due peopl simpli ventur basic essenti suppli self isol want respons hand washer happen run food leav groceri deliveri avail week point thank sub even though pretti sick abl get sick leav today thing quit bad could found sub follow yall advic could respons get mani peopl sick even kill net benefit around well tri look term end like come viru anyway littl peac mind

My bf works in a grocery warehouse so while I’ve been self-isolated for months he cannot be. Thankfully we have a private entrance with a set of steps leading up to our actual apartment. 

I turned that entryway into a disinfectant room, shoes are immediately sprayed with Lysol and left down there. Hand sanitizer. I have baskets for his laundry and signs posted reminding him to be careful taking off his sweaters. The whole nine yards. 

We normally go to a laundry mat but I would not like to do that anymore. I have regular tide. A couple questions for washing clothes in the bathtub. 

1. Should I use my antibacterial dish soap instead of tide?

794,Space efficient/multi use items,"Looking for some more ideas, as I keep working to top up our pantry as long as possible. 

For instance, I’m getting some more cans of tomato paste because they don’t take much space and can be turned into other things. Add a can of water and get tomato sauce. Add 4 cans of water and you have tomato juice. Back in the day, in home ec class I learned to make tomato soup out of a thin white sauce and some tomato paste. Never thought I’d need that knowledge...

Frozen orange juice concentrate can provide a lot of fruit servings without using much freezer space. Popcorn kernels vs bags of popped corn. Pringles vs regular chips. I have the feeling that the same weight of small pasta like orzo and small elbows take up less storage space than larger ones like penne and rotini, although I can’t prove it right at the moment.

796,First thank you to this community and want to introduce myself since I have been posting here,"Hi everyone. This community is amazing and I have gotten valuable tips.  Since I have started to post here, I want to introduce myself in a sense. I am a mostly retired infectious disease researcher who spent 30 years in the pharmaceutical industry in drug development. During my career, I was involved in the H1N1 response as well as working to anticipate pandemic respiratory plague (don't ask right now, LOL).

Again, I do want to thank this community because some of the tips you gave me these past few weeks have been really valuable and I acted on them. As a result, I feel fairly confident I can ""bug in"" for quite awhile.

I have been trying to warn friends and family as well as some online communities that this is serious and to stay in, with mixed results. I will keep trying as I believe that information and knowledge is power and eventually, people will be ready to listen.

Beyond all this, I hope to keep contributing to this community and pass on information that is responsible and reasonable.

811,Front-load panic while we back-load cases,"Today i was giving out some weird advice to others -

While we “flatten the curve”, a.k.a. back-loading the cases, since PANIC is inevitable for everyone, and I do mean EVERYONE, no exceptions, if you’re capable of such a thing, try 

“front-loading the panic”

Like cases, most people experiencing panic will be just before I the true peaking of the cases, but unlike cases, no one begins to panic AFTER the peak of the curve has occurred

Cuz panic is the feeling that fully consumes you for days at a time, and will lead to herd mentality which only increases the risk of infection. But once you’ve experienced it once, you’ll re-emerge having a much clearer mind on how to approach the other problems in life. 

lack of sufficient hazmat gear for medical personnel is obviously main reason for high infection rates for those on frontlines, but their internal emotional collapse of seeing the carnage first hand and have their own panic match the case curve’s trajectory won’t be helpful in strengthening their own immunity at the very least.

Throwaway account. Calculated about 5ish months (1500 cal/day, 2 adults). Please forgive the mismatched units, I did inventory twice, two different ways. Not everything is pictured, but the list below contains pretty much everything besides the fresh produce in our fridge.

I'm expecting this pandemic to last a minimum of 18 months. I unfortunately don't have enough prep to last that long, so probably near the 3 month point we will do another restock, or whenever the panic buying dies down. I ultimately want some freeze-dried food, but its out of stock everywhere I've looked. We live in a big-ish city and planning to bug in until sh\*t starts to get unruly, then we're thinking to bug out to family elsewhere. Bug out location is across 2 state lines, about 1200 miles away. Bug out tips? How's my inventory look? What am I missing? Any other tips? All is very much appreciated. Thanks!

832,I finally had my first “moment”.,"I started very light prepping back in mid-January. It’s not totally out of the ordinary where I’m from because of the winters we get snowed in at least once or twice. So I started stocking up some of the other necessities like soap, sanitizer, long term meal staples, etc. I’ve done a few extra Instacart orders in the last two weeks to calm my anxieties, but I’ve always been able to reassure myself that we’re plenty prepared. 

Well my partner’s parents have a condo community they winter at in Texas with all these friends they’ve made over the last decade or so, and they’ve refused to come home. They’ve joked about it a few times and didn’t take it seriously until a domino effect of them going to the store this week for toilet paper (surprise!!), their condo super closing all the common areas and amenities (no more billiards or water aerobics!), and the siblings all finally harassed them enough that they’re leaving tomorrow morning. 

Guess who gets to be in charge of shopping for stocking up their house with groceries and essentials so they’re okay in case of a lockdown?

833,DIY UV-C Ozone Grocery/Mail Sterilizer,"Made with stuff we had around the farm, there is a fan inside to cool the bulb, and move some air as well.

Big enough for two full grocery bags, or a couple amazon packages.

The thought here is your groceries could have been coughed on or been handled by someone that is infected with COVID-19, or a number of other things you don't want to bring home.

The UV-C Light produces ozone and destroys viruses and bacteria, mold, spores, pretty much anything organic that may be on your items and this is to sterilize your items before they get brought in the house.

Looking for input if its something you'd use in your house.

835,Inexpensive easy to do 3D printed face shield for personal protection (based on PRUSA design),"Hi everyone

I have the chance to own a 3D printer, and I wanted to see how 3D printing communities could help especially considering we have disruptions in the supply chain. Yesterday I found the Prusa Protective face Shield (here: [https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-protective-face-shield-rc1](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-protective-face-shield-rc1)) and I decided to give it a try

**Disclaimer: I’m not a doctor, nor a health specialist. Use it at your own risk. Be aware that materials must be thoroughly cleaned and kept sterile. I cannot be held responsible for what you are doing.** 

**From the PRUSA blog itself: ALWAYS check with a professional to ensure your setup or  production is up to their standards and don’t be offended if they are  cautious to accept your help. I cannot stress this enough, don’t make  things worse and don’t create more trouble for those who are working so hard to keep us all safe and treat those who are sick.** 

I printed a bunch of those in PLA. One of the issue they mention in the blog is the bottleneck for laser cutting the transparent shield out of plexiglass. Since I don’t have plexiglass sheet nor a laser cutter, and I tried to make it even easier to manufacture.

However I have transparent A4 sheets for projectors and I found that a paper puncher ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole\_punch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_punch)) make almost perfect holes for the design. So after a bunch of trial and error I was able to build an inexpensive face mask:

Material needed:  


* 3D printed PRUSA protective face shield
* Transparent sheets (similar to those used for projectors)
* A paper puncher  


You can calibrate the paper puncher to make holes at the right distance. In my case I found that it had to be \~ 35 mm from the edge of the hole. Make sure you take the proper measurement based on the size of your sheets.  


[General Blueprint](https://preview.redd.it/bcklmclv4tn41.png?width=1378&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f46167e70eac5288754afd3a706c9ae97ff9f75b)

You cut several bands of one sheet of your transparent material to test and not waste it.

And after some adjustments, here we are. I also added a bit of tape to make sure the transparent sheet wasn’t falling. I used electrical tape, but maybe it would be better with double sided tape.

[The final result](https://preview.redd.it/76f3urcq0tn41.png?width=2333&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d4b3bb299a52656b6fe379c6d85f7676b9b78e7)

**Conclusion:**

Based on the amazing Prusa design and by chance the holder had the dimension of a standard paper puncher it was possible to create inexpensive disposable face shield.

My arguments are that the economy is crashing and will continue to crash regardless... and also kids in schools will infect each other and then spread it to their families. Just yesterday the school near us had their first case, a 14 year old girl. They are reopening Monday.

I'm grateful to the delivery folks who must be exhausted from their extra workload, to the garbage guys who continue to run, to the teams that keep my internet and cell phone service going.

I'm grateful to all those working in the food and daily 'necessities' for keeping the supply chain maintained as best they can - from the growers/pickers to the truckers to the warehouse workers to the retail store employees.

I'm grateful to all those working in the health care field - the caregivers, the office workers, the cleaning crews.

I'm beyond grateful for my husband who is on the same page with me regarding preparations.  We talk about the worse case scenarios to get them aired, then move ahead.  We have enough to actually share many things as needed (and NONE of it was stocked after the panic buying began).  He is working full steam ahead, without appreciation from administration, to help a hospital keep their employees and patients as safe as they can be.

I'm grateful that all these folks and more are doing what they can for the citizens of our country to keep them as safe and comfortable as they can be, regardless of the idiocy and complaining they may face.

I hope this will be helpful for anyone who is interested in growing their own gardens.","There is so much to learn about gardening, this is just the surface I'm sure. I wrote this up last year to help kick-start my understanding of year-round garden planning. If you yourself are a green thumb and have any recommended edits of the information or wish to add your own tips in this yearly timeline, leave it in the comments and I'll add them. 

***Winter***

* Sow cabbage/cauliflower in modules late winter. Water thoroughly 1 hr before transplant
* Sow strawberries, no need to protect from frost
* Sow sweet peas indoors mid/late winter, sow different times for more, plant 9 in apart on fence
* Sow runner beans 6-8 weeks before last frost
* Cucumbers (thin early to one seedling per pot), squash, zucchini, corn (sow in peat pots)

**After frost is passed**

* Sow tender veggies listed above
* Indicate past frost by observing when local park summer beddings are planted (though may not be feasible in this situation)

**Late Spring (still possible frosts so be careful)**

* Sow corn (50 degree soil) beans, plant potatoes, transplant sweet peas, tomatoes, cabbage and cauliflower
* Sow more of the above for later harvest
* Put straw around strawberries
* Support growing tomatoes on strings

**Early Summer**

* Be vigilant on preventing arising pests and diseases
* Sow beets, carrots, lettuce, turnips
* Transplant cabbage, cauliflower, celery, corn, tomatoes (use plastic sheeting to reduce weeds), squash
* Sow new cabbage and cauliflower for later harvest
* Sow string beans
* Inspect for root flies on cabbage, carrots, onions
* Thin seedlings (in stages)

**Mid Summer**

* Hoe regularly (sorry mom)
* Sow spinach, parsley
* Sow more beets, carrots, lettuce, turnips, string beans
* Plant out late cauliflower, cabbage, leeks
* Boost plants with quick-acting fertilizer if they need help
* Clean up strawberries, done for the season. Cut old leaves, runners, remove straw and weeds
* Remain vigilant on pests. Caterpillars love cabbage

**Late Summer**

* Sow cabbage for spring use
* Tomatoes split when watering is uneven. Dry weather produces hard skins that can't cope with sudden watering. Place straw under low-hanging tomato plants to avoid touching the ground

**Early Autumn**

* Lift onions and potatoes to store
* Cover lettuce, spinach, tomatoes, etc. with cloches/fleece, they will still produce

**Mid Autumn**

* Plant cabbage for spring, bare-root fruit bushes and trees
* Start winter digging on heavy soils

**Late Autumn**

* Winter dig, prune, plant soft fruit like black currants, gooseberries (except cane plants like raspberries) now while plants are dormant! Good sales during this time of year in garden centers
* Prepare fruit foil with lots of rotten manure, compost

**Early Winter**

* Force rhubarb, order seeds/plants, write labels, design and plan

**Late Winter**

* Finish winter digging, apply manures/fertilizers, place cloches to warm soil
* Plant shallots, sow early crops under cloches
* Plant new fruit trees, mulch established fruit trees and bushes with compost/manure
* Cloch strawberries for early crops
* Spray peaches with fungicide if needed (peach leaf curl)",PandemicPreps,1584714469,MindYourBusyness,0,1,True,2020-03-20 07:27:49,much learn gardening surface sure wrote last year help kick start understanding year round garden planning green thumb recommended edits information wish add tips yearly timeline leave comments add sow cabbage cauliflower modules late winter water thoroughly hr transplant sow strawberries need protect frost sow sweet peas indoors mid late winter sow different times plant apart fence sow runner beans weeks last frost cucumbers thin early one seedling per pot squash zucchini corn sow peat pots frost passed sow tender veggies listed indicate past frost observing local park summer beddings planted though may feasible situation spring still possible frosts careful sow corn degree soil beans plant potatoes transplant sweet peas tomatoes cabbage cauliflower sow later harvest put straw around strawberries support growing tomatoes strings summer vigilant preventing arising pests diseases sow beets carrots lettuce turnips transplant cabbage cauliflower celery corn tomatoes use plastic sheeting reduce weeds squash sow new cabbage cauliflower later harvest sow string beans inspect root flies cabbage carrots onions thin seedlings stages summer hoe regularly sorry mom sow spinach parsley sow beets carrots lettuce turnips string beans plant late cauliflower cabbage leeks boost plants quick acting fertilizer need help clean strawberries done season cut old leaves runners remove straw weeds remain vigilant pests caterpillars love cabbage summer sow cabbage spring use tomatoes split watering uneven dry weather produces hard skins cope sudden watering place straw low hanging tomato plants avoid touching ground autumn lift onions potatoes store cover lettuce spinach tomatoes etc cloches fleece still produce autumn plant cabbage spring bare root fruit bushes trees start winter digging heavy soils autumn winter dig prune plant soft fruit like black currants gooseberries except cane plants like raspberries plants dormant good sales time year garden centers prepare fruit foil lots rotten manure compost winter force rhubarb order seeds plants write labels design plan winter finish winter digging apply manures fertilizers place cloches warm soil plant shallots sow early crops cloches plant new fruit trees mulch established fruit trees bushes compost manure cloch strawberries early crops spray peaches fungicide needed peach leaf curl,much learn garden surfac sure wrote last year help kick start understand year round garden plan green thumb recommend edit inform wish add tip yearli timelin leav comment add sow cabbag cauliflow modul late winter water thoroughli hr transplant sow strawberri need protect frost sow sweet pea indoor mid late winter sow differ time plant apart fenc sow runner bean week last frost cucumb thin earli one seedl per pot squash zucchini corn sow peat pot frost pass sow tender veggi list indic past frost observ local park summer bed plant though may feasibl situat spring still possibl frost care sow corn degre soil bean plant potato transplant sweet pea tomato cabbag cauliflow sow later harvest put straw around strawberri support grow tomato string summer vigil prevent aris pest diseas sow beet carrot lettuc turnip transplant cabbag cauliflow celeri corn tomato use plastic sheet reduc weed squash sow new cabbag cauliflow later harvest sow string bean inspect root fli cabbag carrot onion thin seedl stage summer hoe regularli sorri mom sow spinach parsley sow beet carrot lettuc turnip string bean plant late cauliflow cabbag leek boost plant quick act fertil need help clean strawberri done season cut old leav runner remov straw weed remain vigil pest caterpillar love cabbag summer sow cabbag spring use tomato split water uneven dri weather produc hard skin cope sudden water place straw low hang tomato plant avoid touch ground autumn lift onion potato store cover lettuc spinach tomato etc cloch fleec still produc autumn plant cabbag spring bare root fruit bush tree start winter dig heavi soil autumn winter dig prune plant soft fruit like black currant gooseberri except cane plant like raspberri plant dormant good sale time year garden center prepar fruit foil lot rotten manur compost winter forc rhubarb order seed plant write label design plan winter finish winter dig appli manur fertil place cloch warm soil plant shallot sow earli crop cloch plant new fruit tree mulch establish fruit tree bush compost manur cloch strawberri earli crop spray peach fungicid need peach leaf curl

842,The situation in Scotland UK,"Hello,  I have been following this group for a while.  I have always practiced sensible prepping and therefore had a stock of basics before all this kicked off.  Back in January i could see what was happening in China and immediately got some masks, gloves and some hygiene supplies.  Sure enough shortly after those all went.  I then started gathering extra food supplies bit by bit, nothing dramatic.  

The UK is governed by an imbecile and the government advice and actions have been vague and severely lacking.  People were advised against social interactions and unnecessary travel.  Told to not go to bars etc but they were not closed.  It is a shambles and has led to the steep rise to close 4,000 cases in England, and 300 odd confirmed cases in Scotland although this is massively below the true figure.   In the last two weeks there is constant panic buying across the UK and schools shut from today.  Scotland have clearer leadership than in the England through our devolved government, but still people have cleared the shelves here.  You can't get shopping delivery slots for weeks and the shelves are empty of most things.  We are a massively divided country even before all this after Brexit and combined with Scotland wanting independence etc.  I can tell you right now nobody will come together, it will be every person for themselves.  

I live in a city in Scotland that has the highest number of cases in Scotland, more than double of anywhere else.  If things continue they way they are going, i have boxes packed and ready to be loaded into the car to head more rural.

861,THIS is why we prep,"&gt;SEATTLE — Medical leaders in Washington State, which has the highest number of coronavirus deaths in the country, have quietly begun preparing a bleak triage strategy to determine which patients may have to be denied complete medical care in the event that the health system becomes overwhelmed by the coronavirus in the coming weeks.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fearing a critical shortage of supplies, including the ventilators needed to help the most seriously ill patients breathe, state officials and hospital leaders held a conference call on Wednesday night to discuss the plans, according to several people involved in the talks. The triage document, still under consideration, will assess factors such as age, health and likelihood of survival in determining who will get access to full care and who will merely be provided comfort care, with the expectation that they will die.

863,Prepping = anticipating what is to come. Most of us are past the discussion of prepping our pantries. Let's look ahead and discuss the next 6+ months.,"Many people in this sub beat the panic buying and stocked their pantries on time because they anticipated the mayhem and acted on that risk assessment. Now this sub is full with 'victory posts'.. but we're not out of this crisis yet. So let's take time and make a collective effort to discuss what preps we anticipate will be useful for the next 6 months. 

By now, the first panic rushes are behind us. Stocks have more or less replenished (even if the full variety of products isn't being produced at the moment in lieu of production of the more basic products - which is fine). Getting food is not too bothersome if the regular busy hours of the day are avoided. I continue keeping my pantry stocked and I simply rotate through it. We already kept a working pantry before all of this, so we stocked what we ate, and ate what we stocked - no change in behaviour there. We might stock a bit more of the fundamentals (grains, pasta, rice) than we would under regular circumstances, but that's it. 

My government has put all kind of restrictions in place until April. Personally, I do not see these lifted once that date comes. I expect restriction will stay put throughout April at least and probably also throughout May.. depending on how the virus progresses in April, the restrictions might get even tighter. In that case, they will close down all stores and probably implement some kind of curfew system like some places in Europe already have; only allowing you to go outside for select reasons, such as going to get groceries etc. April will be an incredibly critical month for my country, as that's when in our timeline our health care systems will be tested in terms of capacity. 

Even after April-May, it won't be back to business as usual.. it would be a continuously adapting set of regulations in which certain business are/aren't allowed to open up in which the government will try to control the spread of the disease through the population. In terms of societal control/crowd control, come summer, they will HAVE to loosen restrictions somewhat. They can't keep the full population tied up in their houses once the weather gets too nice. People will get too agitated from being cooped up. I'm anticipating that if a lockdown comes in effect, it will be done in April and end by late May.. the government might still keep all public facilities closed (pools etc) over summer and 
put restrictions on public gatherings, but the lockdown scenario is very difficult to maintain. 

While all of this is happening from now until say end of summer, only people in essential services will still be allowed to do their job on site. All others either work from home or are out of jobs. The effects on the economy are tremendous. We're likely heading towards a recession, but other than that, I'm also thinking about what the long term implications of this situation might be for the global supply chains of various (non essential) consumer products. 

I don't think we will run out of food, but I do think it would be good to start brainstorming about what a 3-4 month disruption to the global supply chain system might have to products you might need in the coming 6-12 months AND which products you might need to find yourself in a better position during quarantines / lock downs.

I have made some based on the above thinking based on three timelines: 

1. short-term; potential lock-down in a few weeks from now. 

What (additional) supplies do you need from stores in a 1-2 month time that you can't easily get from your basic grocery store? Example: I keep a bottle of 96% rubbing alcohol in my first aid preps to begin with. I bought extra + a bottle of glycerine. The alcohol can be diluted with water and glycerine to get a 70% alcohol mixture that can serve as a home-made disinfectant. Currently I use store brought disinfectant when outside of my house (using soap is better! Use soap if you can!) but once those are gone, yeah.. this is the one thing I won't be able to buy off the shelf.  

2. Mid-term; prepping for 3-4 months of work-from-home. 

Example: I was planning on buying some new electronics (notably a new laptop) next year. I decided to pull that purchase forward. I did my research and found that right now, shops are still selling at regular prices (though obviously no cool discounts) although local stocks are very limited with many places running out of stock. I predict that consumer electronics will be especially vulnerable to this disruption when looking to the next 6+ months. The components of electronics are sourced from a variety of places and stocks are limited. You only need one missing link in this supply chain to have a problem. Plus, as more regions will get affected over the next months, the demand for electronics will only go up.  

3. Long-term; long-term supply chain disruption. 

This one is hardest to figure out and also a highly personal one. Example: For me, my SO and I take a daily vitamin D supplement, because we're both deficient. Vitamin D is produced mainly in China and India. Already you can hardly find any VitD pills in stores and I'm *guessing* it's because most stores source their private label products from China. We still have enough pills to last the both of us 5-6 months, but yeah.. once the pandemic also hits India, that's going to be problematic. I haven't yet, but I'll probably also pick up some additional VitD pills and extend our supply to at least a year-year and a half. 

Regarding the point 3 alone, in general, I find it incredibly unsettling how little attention is being given to the potential world-wide consequences of what will happen once the pandemic will hit India. Few people seem to realize how vulnerable India will be to a pandemic and how absolutely crucial India is to the flow of goods on the world

867,"I only started prepping 2 weeks ago, but that was enough time for now and am SO glad I came across this sub at that time.","I was going to the grocery store as soon as they opened before my classes started and during my 2 hour breaks everyday for about a week. The stores were fully stocked and dead at the time. I spent probably $80-$100 everyday on canned/frozen food, dog food, some TP that will last my husband and I for a couple of months. I felt like I was going crazy because none of my friends cared and my classmates just thought it was the flu. Granted, they probably have their parents figuring this out while for me it’s just my husband and I. But I had a feeling it would get bad. I haven’t been to the grocery store in a week (once it started getting really bad), whereas I’d usually go every day or every other day for fresh produce.

868,Currently sick - here’s what helps,"Testing is very limited in my area, but I’d say my chances that it’s Covid are about 75%. I don’t suffer seasonal allergies and I got my flu shot (not to say that it’s definitely not the flu, but the likelihood is reduced). We have a number of positive cases here. I can’t take decongestants because I’m breastfeeding and I can’t very well stop now due to the formula shelves being cleared out where I am. 

What’s helping: 

Constant headaches, probably in part due to sinus pressure: nasal rinses. Get you a neti pot or similar device (I have a nasopure), buffered salt and distilled water. A bottle of mist also helps cut down on irritation from being dry after blowing everything out. FYI this and coughing were the first symptoms, not a fever. I was running “warm” for a few days before I was officially in fever territory. 

Coughing: a humidifier does help me sleep at night. I haven’t woken myself up coughing since I started running it at night. 

Fever: I can’t stress this enough...get electrolytes. Tylenol is barely taking the edge off my temp and I’m drenched in sweat most of the night and on and off throughout the day. STAY HYDRATED. 

Shortness of breath: I don’t have it too bad...feels like a mild case of bronchitis where you feel a little wiped/winded after normal activities. Get caught up and stay caught up on your chores, and have East freezer meals ready to go. You’re not going to want to do any of that stuff. 

I have an infant and a toddler. The infant seems to be benefitting from my immune system though breastmilk, but they both ran fevers. Toddler was a little worse off and obviously felt like crap , but they both bounced back and seem mostly normal. Maybe a bit of reduced appetite. If you have kids give them some Tylenol and let them nap it off and graze snacks (I don’t normally allow grazing but my toddler isn’t up to eating full meals). Push the pedialyte. We do have an Owlet that lets us monitor oxygen, but they haven’t had any dips.

877,A protocol I developed for getting in/out of the house,"I've been holed up at home for 2 weeks already, and finally it came the time to take out the trash. It really made me uncomfortable to go out of my apartment so I created this checklist for next time.

I set up 2 baskets next to the entrance :

* **Q-basket** : the quarantine basket, for items that I will drop there when I come back, and quarantine for 72 hours. I used a cardboard box for this one.
* **TMP-Q-basket** : a temporary-quarantine basket, for items that I plan to drop as soon as I get in, but will disinfect immediately because I need to use them right away.


**GETTING OUT:**

1. Wear clothes that are ready to go into landry
2. Hair - tied
3. Hat - on
4. Gloves - on


**GETTING IN:**

1. **Leave shoes outside**

2. Put **goods, house keys**, items that need to be used right away in **TMP-Q basket**

3. **Wash gloves** with soap and water and put them **in Q-basket** without drying. 


4. **Clothes off** --&gt; **Q-basket** or directly into the washer

5. **Wash hands** before grabbing the sanitizer spray bottle

6. **Spray shoes** with sanitizer / Lysol wipe and take them inside 

7. **Spray door handle and entrance light switch** with sanitizier

8. Take items from **TMP-Q basket**, spray with sanitizer and store them.

9. **Wash hands** again

10. Take **Q-basket** outside onto the balcony and leave it there for 72 hours. Note the time / date so you remember.

Notes:

* For gloves, I try to reuse them because I generally practice zero-waste, and I am concerned that if I dispose of gloves every time I have to do something, I will run out completely. 


* Today I just left my shoes outside altogether. I'm not sure if there's a benefit to cleaning or quarantining them.

885,"[Canada] I find myself with feelings of uncertainty on whether I'm good to stop going to the stores. So, I'm looking to share my overly-detailed spreadsheet and receive some feedback to hopefully put my nerves at ease (or prompt another trip to the stores).","Some further details: Male, 28, living in Canada in a bachelor apartment alone. I started prepping back in early February, and I made my last trip to Costco on March 11.

I wanted to be able to survive without going for groceries for a few months, which I know I've done, however I feel like my current prep has some holes that need filling. I'm considering one last run to top up on a few items. I'm going to omit what those items are (from this post at least) to remove any bias associated with feedback. I'm currently projected to have 3.5 months of balanced diet consuming 2000 calories a day. This calorie target sits well given that my TDEE during the following months will be around 2000 if I continue to remain sedentary at home. 

I've always been one to meal prep as prior to all of this, I used to work out a lot, and meal prepping/nutrition is a key component of making progress at the gym. So, getting ready for this pandemic in some ways came naturally. I prepared a spreadsheet that is overly detailed to most so I can track my nutrition. My primary driving force to was actually based on expiration dates - I wanted to make sure whatever I bought didn't go to waste, as I'm pretty frugal. However, as the days went on and the news became more alarming, I began to spend more time filling in other details. Perhaps you will find something to take away from how I've kept track of my inventory (and I'd be happy to chat about my spreadsheet if you have questions about it).

I've separated things into two lists:

886,"I built a DIY UV Sterilizing Box to kill Coronavirus on our Packages, Shoes, Phones and more","&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tbw8c95im9o41.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d1062c714be25ee871e69855221fa496f8d0a1f

&amp;#x200B;

I have a family of 4, and was worried that our mail, amazon packages, shoes, phones, keys, and clothing could unsuspectingly bring COVID-19 into our home.

I couldn't find anything to buy that was big enough to fit an amazon package into, so I built our own UV light sterilizing box.

The whole thing cost less than $100. Not sure if other people are interested in building the same thing. If so...please respond and I'll send you my materials list and how I built it.

Caveat: I am not a medical professional. If you found some holes in my research that will help us all, please do share, as I am trying to find the perfect solution to protect my family.

How it Works:

&amp;#x200B;

* It uses UV-C wavelength light to kill Coronavirus (must be UV-C and NOT UV-A or UV-B, according to my research). UV-C in range of 250-280nm is the sweet spot. (nanometer wavelength).

""UVC radiation, in the range of 250 nm - 280 nm, renders harmful micro-organisms such as bacteria and viruses ineffective, by destroying the genetic information in the DNA. The micro-organisms lose their reproductive capability and are destroyed."" Source: [http://www.cisuvc.com/ask-an-expert/what-is-uvc](http://www.cisuvc.com/ask-an-expert/what-is-uvc)

""The novel coronavirus is a kind of positive-sense single-stranded RNV virus, same as the SARS and MERS virus. Researches on SARS found that this kind of virus is sensitive to heat radiation and UVC light and can be diminished when exposure to UVC irradiation stronger than 90 μW/cm2. Thus, in theory, UV light would be able to destroy the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov)."" Source: [https://www.ledinside.com/news/2020/2/uvled\_coronavirus](https://www.ledinside.com/news/2020/2/uvled_coronavirus)

\-In order to achieve the 90 μW/cm requirement, I selected a 36W, 120V, UV-C light to achieve 120µW/cm².

\-I used very thick plexiglass for the viewport (so that I can see into the box and check to make sure the light is working).

""Even very thin acrylic sheets of less than 5 millimeters (mm) do not let UV-C light penetrate.""

887,Filter material for DIY masks,"Ok reddit, can you guys help me out?

I’m sending some masks up to family in WNY who work in healthcare and didn’t anticipate this. My cousin has been given one mask and has been told to clean it. Yikes. Thank goodness I bought enough for myself and my immediate family. 

But one of my aunts sews, and I had already told her about people making victory masks. I’m sending some wire I happen to have and elastic from Halloween crafts I had on hand. I hear they’re sold out everywhere up there. 

But for the filter material, what are some options? 
I was considering buying some AC filters and taking them apart to get the material. Im not trying to make more than two trips as I have to bring my kiddo and use our stash of masks and gloves. This morning in my swfl Publix they had plenty of AC filters. They’re not cheap so I expect them to be there tmrw morning. 

I can’t think of any other material that’s better than that. My aunt can sew the scraps. 

I get that they’re not the best, but they are better than nothing at all.

889,I felt really great about my preps. But now my family is sick &amp; it feels absolutley worthless.," The house is stocked to ride this out for 6-8 weeks. 

We've been productive since January....  

My husband is working from home. 
I've lost my job until this blows over. Either way,  I was glad we were both HOME.  

We've been home for 7+ days with what felt like MINIMAL activities outside the house.  But enough trips to have concern.  

That being said,  my husband is now ill.  
Sore throat,  dry cough, sore joints. No fever yet. 
2 year old Son has mild fever &amp; diarrhea.  

Husband has been quarantined in the Master Bedroom for the last 24 hours and everything is starting to feel surreal. 

We MIGHT be stuck in this house with THE invisible disease we were trying to avoid. 
So far,  we can't get tested to rule it out. Talk about anxiety/panic/etc.
 
Im 4+ months pregnant.  So I've contacted my OB to see if we can get approved for testing but i'm not holding my breath.  

Hindsight 20/20...


Here's what I would do differently: 

1. Finished ""shopping"" last week. 
No matter how badly you think you need something at the store.... don't go.  
Im re-thinking every trip we've made this week  &amp; wondering if it was worth it?  

2. Prepared a quarantine room earlier instead of today, by myself,  with a sick 2 year old to manage. 

I've put the following in his room for comfort: 

A) Mini- fridge with bottled water,  seltzer water,  milk,   cold brew coffee, cheese, snacks etc
B) Snack tote:  quick, dry snacks, chips, granola,  cereal
C) Sick tote: vitamin c, men's multi,  mucinex,  nyquil, rubbing alcohol,  hydrogen peroxide
D) Cleaning tote: large tote with dish soap &amp; sponge,  toilet cleaner, Disinfectant wipes, Kleenex, paper towels &amp; plenty of TP. 

We have a patio door &amp; I deliver food/ goods 
Then he comes outside to get it once I've left the patio. 

3. I wish I had Mentally prepared myself for the eventual weight of this.  ALL OF THIS.  
2 vacations, canceled.  
My Small business income,  gone. 
The Constant reminder of fear &amp; anxiety on EVERY channel.  EVERY social media site.  Etc.  Or memes/ jokes.... which I was happily sharing aswell.  
But the possibility of MY family being sick... I didn't prep that feeling.  Assuming ""it won't happen to us"" might have been my biggest mistake.  
Guilt,  fear,  anxiety,  anger... these were not emotions I was feeling 24 hours ago.

890,Fearing for the worst.,"Guys I'm really scared that as more and more people begin to lose jobs and the less food/supplies there are that there will be people who will break in and steal food. I live in L.A (crappy part of the city). Once a homeless man jumped over our wall and tried to get papayas and this was before the virus. We will get homeless and drunk people walking on the sidewalk up front. What if they get hungry and try and steal food? What of people who lost jobs? Last night we heard 6 gunshots and honestly it's making me anxious. 

There is a wall that is easy to jump over. It is small and then progresses to be big. Over the wall is a drive way for apartments (anyone can look over basically) and on our side it is a long alleyway and it progresses to our backyard. It is smaller towards the front yard and easy to jump over. My family and I started making booby traps. Such as sharpened nails that stay up and glass bottles with nails in them and cans with coins to alert us of anything as well as an alarm that (sort of works). Am I being paranoid or is this something that we should be doing? Our supply is in a shed in the back yard and in a room that is outside.

891,Modified food rotation idea,"Hi all.  I'm the guy who set my microwave on fire a few posts ago, but I think I may have a more useful bit of information that I've been noticing lately.

Like many of you, I had a stash of shelf-stable food that sits in a cool dark place and doesn't get moved much.  Sort of a resource of last resort if SHTF - something only to be opened if there's a real emergency.  Aside from that is my pantry, which is usually pretty full of canned food which does get rotated on a regular basis.  Finally is the fridge/freezer, which have traditionally been eaten to emptiness, then refilled as needed.

During COVIDfest 2020, I've sort of fallen into a method for dealing with food that really seems to work.  I've filled the freezer with tasty foods that I usually eat and filled the fridge with various easily spoiled foods such as milk, bread, eggs, fresh produce, and so forth.  However, one thing I never counted on was that I could easily resupply with very little risk to myself by ordering groceries to be delivered online.  As a result, my stores are as stocked as they were on the first day and I've been eating very well.  

What other ways have the rest of you been getting the most out of your food prepping?  I'm curious to hear how I can be doing better.",PandemicPreps,1584938430,w_murderface,12,1,True,2020-03-22 21:40:30,hi guy set microwave fire posts ago think may useful bit information noticing lately many stash shelf stable food sits cool dark place get moved much sort resource last resort shtf something opened real emergency aside pantry usually pretty full canned food get rotated regular basis finally fridge freezer traditionally eaten emptiness refilled needed covidfest sort fallen method dealing food really seems work filled freezer tasty foods usually eat filled fridge various easily spoiled foods milk bread eggs fresh produce forth however one thing never counted could easily resupply little risk ordering groceries delivered online result stores stocked first day eating well ways rest getting food prepping curious hear better,hi guy set microwav fire post ago think may use bit inform notic late mani stash shelf stabl food sit cool dark place get move much sort resourc last resort shtf someth open real emerg asid pantri usual pretti full can food get rotat regular basi final fridg freezer tradit eaten empti refil need covidfest sort fallen method deal food realli seem work fill freezer tasti food usual eat fill fridg variou easili spoil food milk bread egg fresh produc forth howev one thing never count could easili resuppli littl risk order groceri deliv onlin result store stock first day eat well way rest get food prep curiou hear better
892,Preparing to get sick,"There has been a lot of discussion about preparing for isolation, but not much about preparing in case you actually get sick.  Unless you are able to completely isolate for the foreseeable future, there is a reasonable change of catching the virus and being sick either at home or in hospital.   It is important to be prepared to look after yourself and/or other family members if that happens.

For myself, I am preparing for two main scenarios - either sick at home for a week or so where I am not up to doing much, or hospital admission of 1-2 weeks.   I live alone with 2 dogs who will need to be fed, and don’t want to rely on having family help, both for their safety and because I can’t guarantee they will not be sick or unable to travel.

For the first scenario I am mostly just making sure I am up to date on all the cleaning &amp; washing etc, and that I have meals prepared (including dog food).   I have panadol, and will organise a water bottle for next to the bed. 

For the second scenario, I have organised a hospital bag with some clothes and toiletries.  I also have basic contact information etc. written down.    My big concern here is the dogs - in these circumstances there is not always anyone able to help out and they may be left on their own.  They have a dog door with access to the garden and I have ordered a self filling water bowl for outside, and have two timed feeders for dry food which hold enough food for nearly a month.    Hopefully someone will be able to come and look after them, but this gives me peace of mind.

I would love to hear any suggestions and about how others are preparing in case they get sick.",PandemicPreps,1584943911,BrightFadedDog,6,1,True,2020-03-22 23:11:51,lot discussion preparing isolation much preparing case actually get sick unless able completely isolate foreseeable future reasonable change catching virus sick either home hospital important prepared look family members happens preparing two main scenarios either sick home week much hospital admission weeks live alone dogs need fed want rely family help safety guarantee sick unable travel first scenario mostly making sure date cleaning washing etc meals prepared including dog food panadol organise water bottle next bed second scenario organised hospital bag clothes toiletries also basic contact information etc written big concern dogs circumstances always anyone able help may left dog door access garden ordered self filling water bowl outside two timed feeders dry food hold enough food nearly month hopefully someone able come look gives peace mind would love hear suggestions others preparing case get sick,lot discuss prepar isol much prepar case actual get sick unless abl complet isol forese futur reason chang catch viru sick either home hospit import prepar look famili member happen prepar two main scenario either sick home week much hospit admiss week live alon dog need fed want reli famili help safeti guarante sick unabl travel first scenario mostli make sure date clean wash etc meal prepar includ dog food panadol organis water bottl next bed second scenario organis hospit bag cloth toiletri also basic contact inform etc written big concern dog circumst alway anyon abl help may left dog door access garden order self fill water bowl outsid two time feeder dri food hold enough food nearli month hope someon abl come look give peac mind would love hear suggest other prepar case get sick
893,"My wife, myself and our baby are sick.","So I have prepped for 2 months.  Everything you can imagine.  You name it.  

1.5 weeks ago we left our 6.5 month old baby girl with my mom and my wife and I went super early to the local grocery coop grocery store (in Canada).  At this point Canada (our province only had like 100 cases)... so we were pretty confident we would be ok if we go super early where there’s no one yet at the store.

So we load up on more stuff for the baby (just honestly extras to make life more comfortable).  Plus things for ourselves as well.

We are good to go with gloves and hand sanitizer.  We thought no need to dip into our n95s for this relatively safe run out.

At the til, my wife goes to grab more bread... I’m standing directly across from the cashier. And it happens.... AAAAAACHOOOOOOO !!!!! The lady sneezes towards her til (she turned her head) but still.... I was mortified.

My wife comes back and I tell her and we both are rushing to get out of there.  We bathe in hand sanitizer when we get to our truck.  But too late; the damage has been done.

Fast forward 3.5 days later; and all 3 of us, including our 6 month old daughter (who had yet to catch a cold or flu) are all sick as hell.  None of us have had a fever; but we are run down; feel like crap and have a tickle / slight cough.  We could have covid19 with suuuuuper mild symptoms; or nothing at all.  The fear is insane.

894,"Mindset prep, .. we're here, and now everyone wants to kill you","Not literally, of course, but it's a frame of mind that I think is useful as we enter into this new phase where the virus is spreading unchecked throughout western countries, exponentially (my opinion).  It's time to start thinking of everyone, everywhere, as an alien creature that has toxic breath, coughs out toxic clouds, leaves poisons on everything it touches, and start avoiding these creatures at all costs.  Smile, of course, .. but everyone is dangerous to you for at least the next few months, and the dumber they are, the more dangerous they are.

For now and into the near future, every trip to the market is a risk to your life.  Every knock on the door a threat.  Every gathering of people a potential death trap.

Every other person's failures are now threats to your life.  If they won't stop shaking hands, they are a threat to you.  If they won't stop going to the bar, they are a threat.  If they keep eating at restaurants, they are a threat.  It's time to stop playing nice, and start instituting zero tolerance with these people ... they are risking their lives, and you are letting them risk yours if you keep being near them.  This could be co-workers, this could be friends, or family, it could even be someone in your own home (the most dangerous).  It's time to start saying enough is enough, and drawing lines, and making boundaries for this kind of behavior.

It's time to start taking it seriously.  Up until now it was almost like playing pretend, like you were preparing for a pandemic, but you knew in your heart that there weren't really that many sick people around you, so you took chances.  You went to the market more than you needed to, got that last pizza delivered, went somewhere without the mask, gave a hug to a family member, shook your customer's hand after a meeting, let your kid spend time with one of their friends.  It's time to stop all of that, because it isn't a game anymore.  People are sick everywhere now, and there are many more of them than are being reported where you live.  Yes, maybe only 1 or 2 have been reported in your county, many even none, but that's because they haven't been testing for it.  The reality is that they are out there, everywhere, and even if they weren't, they will be soon, and you won't know when or where.  It's time to stop taking chances, and stop worrying about what other people think about the mask and other PPE, .. it's time to be careful.  If you haven't had an experience where you find out that someone you were in contact with a few days earlier was found to have the virus, you will have that experience soon.

Ultimately the good news and the bad news is that you can only get the virus from other people.  That's good news if you protect yourself and stay away from them, and bad news it you can't do that.  And let's face it .. some people can't.  Some people just can't stay away from other people, they are too social for it, too dependent, or for whatever reason they just won't stay away ... so its time to demand they stay away from you.

Finally, for the infected, we care, we don't blame you, and you didn't do anything wrong ... eventually we'll all probably be on the other side, infected ourselves, but for now we want to try to keep that from happening so the hospitals don't get overwhelmed.

896,What do you use to disinfect house?,"For the past couple weeks, our daily routine in the morning is wiping down heavily touched surfaces such as remotes, faucets, doorknobs, phones, etc. Then every Saturday morning we do a deeper cleaning of floors, tables, rugs with an emphasis on bathroom and kitchen.

What does everyone use to actually disinfect? Lysol wipes, bleach spray, lysol spray?

We feel our best option is lysol wipes since you can wipe around any object and it's not harmful to certain surfaces. For example, if you spray the lysol disinfectant spray on a doorknob or your faucets, it won't clean the backside of the doorknob or underside of the faucet. And lysol disinfectant spray you're not supposed to use on painted wood (kitchen knobs) or other surfaces whereas the wipes are OK on all surfaces.

I have another friend who is inviting us all to her place because “we aren’t going out anywhere!” Or one of them thinks it’s too late to contain it so why bother? Wants to start going out everywhere by next week...even though her own family has someone who is prone to pneumonia...someone with cardiac issues...and someone immunocompromised. 

A friend who is currently sick with a sore throat and runny nose, etc. probably has a common cold. But he still goes out and picks up food and lives his life. Wants to go to his workplace office to pick up things...

I also all of a sudden have people asking me for things like hand sanitizer, masks and Clorox wipes! Things that are most certainly sold out everywhere. I haven’t even told them how much I’ve prepped. They just assume that since I was telling them a month ago “somethings coming” I must have an endless supply of these coveted items.

922,Cameras,"I saw another post about a stolen car and instead of taking that post over I thought I'd post here.  I'm certainly not a security expert but this is what I've done for day to day monitoring of my property.  2 ring doorbells wired to the existing doorbells.  I purchased both from. Amazon warehouse for $50  each. If you don't know Amazon warehouse sells stuff people have returned at a lower price.  Anything Im not sure about and more want to try I'll buy from there. Ive saved 100s of dollars and have only had an issue once. (Cat tower,  we just used our own hardware). The ring doorbells will alert my phone if anyone gets within 30ish feet of either of my doors. I can also have a conversation with anyone who is there.  When Lowes was early delivering our new appliances we could tell them we'd be along shortly. 

Rings can also be used without  existing wiring but you have to recharge their batteries.  

In addition to the rings I have a set of 8 closed circuit cameras that monitor my pool,  driveway,  backyard,  side yard, garage. They are connected to a monitor which is in my bedroom. Once again, bought them through Amazon warehouse. I think the set of 8 was $350. They are definitely not top of the line by any means. They are wireless for the circuit but do require a power outlet.  You can get them wired.  I love these too.  

My situation is very large house on about 2 acres.  Rural.

933,N95 options,"Lots of questions and debates on this topic and lots of misinformation. I was able to secure some Harbor Freight dust masks #01949 before this all hit, only about 60 however. Not n95 quality but we're beyond that now. 

My wife works behind the scenes at a major hospital and while she be iesnt come into contact with patients, she's around nurses often. Apparently her hospital only has about a week or 2 worth of ppe's left over including masks. I'm planning on giving her some of these masks to wear at work should she need them but I've also been looking into alternative n95 options and would like some insight.

934,"SURVEY: Self-Quarantine Risks &amp; Repercussions: Physical Safety, Mental Health, and Nonconforming Identities. [Help a Graduate Student with Research]","Hey guys! Since I know everyone is spending way too much time at home on the internet and hopefully feeling bored enough to complete a survey about the how the recently imposed self-isolation ordinances have impacted your interpersonal relationships, your identity, and your overall wellbeing - I thought I'd try to enlist the reddit community for help.


The survey data will be used for research purposes (unpublished graduate coursework in preparation for creating my thesis project) and since current research and mainstream media are purely concerned with economic or respiratory illness effects (therefore there are ZERO peer-reviewed journals to gain relevant information) - I thought I would try to utilize my own survey to try to understand some of the social/psychological symptoms of the current global crisis.


TAKE IT HERE: https://forms.gle/e4WjdsmvwHzopSm88



Read about it below:

Firstly,

THANK YOU! I appreciate your time &amp; effort to provide much need info regarding the sidelined conversations concerning recently imposed self-isolation ordinances. 


This survey will ask you questions regarding the impact of this current global crisis on your physical, mental, emotional, sexual, financial, psychological, and social wellbeing.


This research is for a graduate seminar course and will not be published. I am hoping to further investigate this topic for my future thesis project. The purpose of this survey is to provide a preliminary understanding surrounding the traumas and trials of people existing outside of the media's current attention - since there are currently no supplementary publications on this topic thus yet, I figured I'd try to gather some of my own data.


Secondly,

Please note that this survey is 100% ANONYMOUS. If you choose to email me outside of the survey, all of your personal information will be kept private.


Thirdly,

Please feel free to skip ANY question that doesn't pertain to you or makes you feel uncomfortable. You can answer as many or as few questions as you so choose.


Thank you again for being willing to share your story!


Fourthly,

SHARE THIS SURVEY! Again, there isn't ANY academic information currently available on this topic which means people are suffering in silence while the world's attention is elsewhere. There are many more ways this virus can hurt people than just causing a respiratory infection. The topics discussed in this survey are an extremely important part of maintaining a 'healthy population' and hopefully the more popular this gets - the more visible it becomes.


Thank you!

942,For those of you using delivery services,"I want to start off by saying thank you to all of you who have shared information on the Covid subs. It's because of you guys that I was able to prepare. I know many of you are using delivery services during this pandemic and I wanted to share my experience from the other day. Please keep in mind this message is dependent on where you live and how well you know your neighbors.

I live in an urban area and the usual activity of dog walkers, bikers and pedestrians has ground to a halt. My neighborhood is very quiet now. I had my groceries delivered in the morning. Like many, my back patio is used as a ""decontamination zone"" where I leave bags to sit before throwing them out. While wiping the groceries down, I noticed a man I didn't recognize, lingering in my back alleyway. Many folks use the alley as a walk through but for an unexplainable reason, I felt compelled to keep my eye on this guy. I watched as he started to walk in one direction and abruptly turn around and walk the opposite way until he disappeared. Odd behavior but it was quickly forgotten as I was focused on the task at hand, which was bringing my groceries inside.

Many hours later I hear my back patio door trying to be opened. I then hear a tapping at the window and a man yelling ""HELLO HELLO!"" I step out to discover it's the man who was hanging around earlier. He proceeds to ask me for a ride to the store. Shocked and confused at this stranger in my back yard who tried to enter my home in broad daylight , I asked him to identify himself. He lied and claimed he was a neighbor from 2 doors down and even went as far to give a false description of a home. I told him no and he proceeds to demand meat and money from me. He was very insistent, irate and began hassling me as I continued to say no. I asked if he spoke to other neighbors and he said no, I was his first stop. I live in the midst of numerous homes, I am not the first house on the block. This stranger targeted me after observing my grocery delivery and watched me bring them into my patio. Suffice it to say I called the police.

I've seen a few posts in the past month, suggesting people to help their fellow neighbors with food and supplies. This is the right sentiment and many people's first instincts are to help one another but there's also many people looking to exploit.

943,Is breaking quarantine an act of violence?,"Our ""invisible enemy"" is most certainly a violent thing, especially for the unknown but not insignificant fraction of cases that get serious and critical.

So if a quarantine policy has been agreed upon by all members of a dwelling, and then one or more Covidiots casually breaks it without getting clearance from others, is that not an indirect act of violence?

Hmm, perhaps a bit like Driving While Intoxicated (DWI)?

I'm still on my supplies but sooner or later I'll go to buy again.

Regarding products that need refrigeration, I was thinking to put everything in a plastic bag, close it and put in the fridge, and wait 4-5 days...

- is it a good idea, or moving boxes inside bag may diffuse the virus around? Obviously I'll use gloves and trash them

953,"I LOST MY JOB last week because of COVID-19. For anyone else who has lost their job in the last few weeks, the Change Curve has shown me how to make it through this","Job loss can be an extremely difficult change to go through. With the recent rise in unemployment, there are so many people who already have or are worried about losing their job. Since I recently lost mine due to the pandemic, I realized that it is very easy to get down on yourself during this time.

I found the Kubler-Ross Change Curve which has shown me the stages that one generally goes through before they can pick themselves back up again. Over the course of this curve, productive can sharply drop, but it will eventually pick back up again and go to a new high.

The Change Curve can help one with dealing with the change that job loss and layoffs can bring. There are 3 stages that I have listed:

1. Shock &amp; Denial
2. Frustration &amp; Depression
3. Experimentation, Decision &amp; Integration

During this time be sure to keep relying on your Rational brain and not let your Limbic/Feeling side control you. This tends to happen far too often.

Keep your head up. Your time will come.

971,How many n95s is it ethical to keep?,"How many masks is the right amount to keep per person? Is there a right answer?

I bought 40 n95s to split between 4 people back in January. At the time, I thought I was buying the absolute bare minimum, but I didn’t want to clear the shelves and be a hoarder. I was going to follow the rotation/ paper bag protocol and hope for the best.

Turns out my (insane) parents refuse to wear them, and my husband can easily work from home. I pretty much have 40 n95s to myself.

I’m a barber, with a compromised immune system. I suspect the government will open the shops again, before the vaccine is available. Presuming I’ll need to wear one everyday for several months 35-40 doesn’t seem like a crazy amount. It still feels minimal.

But with healthcare workers out of masks already, it feels wrong to keep so many. But is it? I, and presumably all of you, took the initiative to take care of ourselves. Now I feel like society thinks we’re evil for keeping that safety to ourselves.

How many masks is the right amount to keep per person? What have you decided? Have any of you donated some of your masks?

972,Ethics of keeping what's yours ... (LONG),"Lots to posts lately about people feeling guilty for having things when others don't, keeping their N95 masks and other preps when others don't have them, etc, and I'm bewildered by it.

Look, assuming you didn't steal your preps, .. you went out and worked to make money.  Maybe as a hair dresser, maybe on a construction crew, maybe delivering things with a truck, or as lawyer, or teacher.  You worked .. and society gave you a marker against that work, money.  You earned it.  Then you spent it to prepare yourself for the future.  So what you bought with your own labor, it's yours.

Other people did not do that .. they may have worked, but they spent their money on something else.  Maybe something important, college classes, maybe they pissed it away at the bowling alley, or eating marshmallow peeps, but whatever it was .. they decided that prepping was not as important as whatever they were doing with their money.  That was their choice.  They made that choice on their own.

When they were choosing to do those things, do you think they felt bad because you weren't doing them to ?  Were you going to them saying that you knew they had been able to go a restaurant when you didn't, would it be okay if you have some of their meal ?  Did you say, wow, you went bowling, is it okay if I bowl a few frames on your dime ?  Were you like, oh wow that's great makeup you bought, mind if I use it on Thursdays and Fridays since I didn't buy that ?  Did you say, you know, my house isn't really as nice as yours, is it okay if I live here in November ?  No, hell no you didn't .. you just did without whatever they were spending their earned money on, because whatever they bought is theirs, not yours.

But now, just because circumstances have changed and your preps are being envied you're feeling guilty because you have prepared and others haven't ?  Why do you feel guilty about that, I don't understand that.  I mean it's your stuff .. you earned the money, you thought ahead and decided to prepare, you did without while you were preparing, and you saved away preps to use during an emergency.  So why, now, are you bothered when other people want what you have ?  How is that fair that they would even bring it up in conversation, or that you would feel obligated in any way to give them anything ?

You aren't being an asshole, you're not being mean, or hateful, ... it is perfectly just for your to keep what you've bought with your own labor.  It's yours.

For all this talk of people feeling guilty of having N95 masks, etc, .. when did your doctor ever offer to give you a free doctor's visit because your husband was out of work, or the hospital ever call to tell you they were having a special on xrays, or your health insurance company call to say they were cutting your rates ?  Yeah, it's tough for nurses and doctors right now ... shit sucks, I don't envy them, and yes they are heroes, but it is their job to be doing what they are doing, and it is the hospital's job to make sure they have what they need.  That's literally not your job, that was the hospital administrator's job, and the board members that sit on the board of directors of the hospital's job, not the job of some random person who just happened to buy some masks at home depot.  Doctors and nurses make plenty of money ... even if their hospitals weren't preparing, they've seen the news and know WTF is going on, they could have got masks if they cared that much, same as you.  If anything you should be pissed off that they are providing masks to YOU if you are a patient at the hospital, because they should have prepared for this eventuality.

And that's the best case that can be made for giving preps away ... every other argument for it is even weaker.  Food, water, toilet paper, and whatever random shit your distant friends are in need of ... again, just not your damn problem.  You didn't go out and work, save money, prepare, etc, just to run a free grocery store for all the neighbors when SHTF.",PandemicPreps,1585492699,Intense_Resolve,116,1,True,2020-03-29 07:38:19,lots posts lately people feeling guilty things others keeping n masks preps others etc bewildered assuming steal preps went worked make money maybe hair dresser maybe construction crew maybe delivering things truck lawyer teacher worked society gave marker work money earned spent prepare future bought labor people may worked spent money something else maybe something important college classes maybe pissed away bowling alley eating marshmallow peeps whatever decided prepping important whatever money choice made choice choosing things think felt bad going saying knew able go restaurant would okay meal say wow went bowling okay bowl frames dime like oh wow great makeup bought mind use thursdays fridays since buy say know house really nice okay live november hell without whatever spending earned money whatever bought circumstances changed preps envied feeling guilty prepared others feel guilty understand mean stuff earned money thought ahead decided prepare without preparing saved away preps use emergency bothered people want fair would even bring conversation would feel obligated way give anything asshole mean hateful perfectly keep bought labor talk people feeling guilty n masks etc doctor ever offer give free doctor visit husband work hospital ever call tell special xrays health insurance company call say cutting rates yeah tough nurses doctors right shit sucks envy yes heroes job hospital job make sure need literally job hospital administrator job board members sit board directors hospital job job random person happened buy masks home depot doctors nurses make plenty money even hospitals preparing seen news know wtf going could got masks cared much anything pissed providing masks patient hospital prepared eventuality best case made giving preps away every argument even weaker food water toilet paper whatever random shit distant friends need damn problem go work save money prepare etc run free grocery store neighbors shtf,lot post late peopl feel guilti thing other keep n mask prep other etc bewild assum steal prep went work make money mayb hair dresser mayb construct crew mayb deliv thing truck lawyer teacher work societi gave marker work money earn spent prepar futur bought labor peopl may work spent money someth els mayb someth import colleg class mayb piss away bowl alley eat marshmallow peep whatev decid prep import whatev money choic made choic choos thing think felt bad go say knew abl go restaur would okay meal say wow went bowl okay bowl frame dime like oh wow great makeup bought mind use thursday friday sinc buy say know hous realli nice okay live novemb hell without whatev spend earn money whatev bought circumst chang prep envi feel guilti prepar other feel guilti understand mean stuff earn money thought ahead decid prepar without prepar save away prep use emerg bother peopl want fair would even bring convers would feel oblig way give anyth asshol mean hate perfectli keep bought labor talk peopl feel guilti n mask etc doctor ever offer give free doctor visit husband work hospit ever call tell special xray health insur compani call say cut rate yeah tough nurs doctor right shit suck envi ye hero job hospit job make sure need liter job hospit administr job board member sit board director hospit job job random person happen buy mask home depot doctor nurs make plenti money even hospit prepar seen news know wtf go could got mask care much anyth piss provid mask patient hospit prepar eventu best case made give prep away everi argument even weaker food water toilet paper whatev random shit distant friend need damn problem go work save money prepar etc run free groceri store neighbor shtf

975,My mom thinks this is just the flu,"To be honest this probably is more of an r/relationships sort of post, but this sub is one of the more friendly and chill places on Reddit. I just don’t really have anyone to vent to. 

My mom is over 60 and doesn’t see the need to stop going to her food service job. She and I have always had a rocky relationship, but we live far apart now, so things have gotten better. A few years ago I made the decision to limit our conversations to pleasant chit-chat, because as unpleasant as it is to think about, I know her years here are limited and I don’t want us to spend them arguing. So I basically just tell her what’s going on in my life and don’t ever offer a dissenting thought. 

But I’m upset because she keeps sending me articles about how COVID is blown out of proportion. I just ignore them; I wouldn’t know how to respond without causing an argument. This is why my childhood was kind of fucked up; I was never allowed to have a different opinion than her, and she takes any counter-argument as some sort of personal attack. Previously I’ve had a conversation with her about how we prepped and how I took a LOA from my job, hoping she would think about taking similar steps. She didn’t. 

But today she sent me an essay written by a medical professional from her church, who argues that not holding in-person church services is giving into fear, therefore unbiblical. He also talks about how plenty of another things are more deadly, like seasonal flu, car accidents, TB, etc. yet we don’t fear those nearly as much. I feel like by sending me this she is implying that I’m doing something wrong by self-quarantining. 

I’m also a Christian, and this infuriates me. I haven’t “given into fear.” I simply perceive this as a threat and think we all should take steps to avoid it. I had to tell her what I think, and she hasn’t said anything back yet. 

I feel like I’m melting into a plane between reality. I’m fortunate to live in an area that’s barely affected, (yet), hopefully never. There’s such a disconnect between what I read on the news and what I see outside. It doesn’t feel real, but I’m still convicted that I’m doing the right thing. 

Anyone else have family that won’t listen to information that doesn’t line up with their worldview? I mean I guess I’m kind of doing the same thing. It’s hard having to rely on other people’s word, especially when health officials and government are so divided.",PandemicPreps,1585513459,12sideddied,16,8,True,2020-03-29 13:24:19,honest probably r relationships sort post sub one friendly chill places reddit really anyone vent mom see need stop going food service job always rocky relationship live far apart things gotten better years ago made decision limit conversations pleasant chit chat unpleasant think know years limited want us spend arguing basically tell going life ever offer dissenting thought upset keeps sending articles covid blown proportion ignore know respond without causing argument childhood kind fucked never allowed different opinion takes counter argument sort personal attack previously conversation prepped took loa job hoping would think taking similar steps today sent essay written medical professional church argues holding person church services giving fear therefore unbiblical also talks plenty another things deadly like seasonal flu car accidents tb etc yet fear nearly much feel like sending implying something wrong self quarantining also christian infuriates given fear simply perceive threat think take steps avoid tell think said anything back yet feel like melting plane reality fortunate live area barely affected yet hopefully never disconnect read news see outside feel real still convicted right thing else family listen information line worldview mean guess kind thing hard rely people word especially health officials government divided,honest probabl r relationship sort post sub one friendli chill place reddit realli anyon vent mom see need stop go food servic job alway rocki relationship live far apart thing gotten better year ago made decis limit convers pleasant chit chat unpleas think know year limit want us spend argu basic tell go life ever offer dissent thought upset keep send articl covid blown proport ignor know respond without caus argument childhood kind fuck never allow differ opinion take counter argument sort person attack previous convers prep took loa job hope would think take similar step today sent essay written medic profession church argu hold person church servic give fear therefor unbibl also talk plenti anoth thing deadli like season flu car accid tb etc yet fear nearli much feel like send impli someth wrong self quarantin also christian infuri given fear simpli perceiv threat think take step avoid tell think said anyth back yet feel like melt plane realiti fortun live area bare affect yet hope never disconnect read news see outsid feel real still convict right thing els famili listen inform line worldview mean guess kind thing hard reli peopl word especi health offici govern divid

987,Moving during a pandemic,"Long story short, we’ll need to vacate the house we’re renting from family in a few months. Hopefully we’ll be past peak infection by then. We had originally planned to purchase the house we’re renting but it makes more financial sense for us to buy a different home. Luckily, this will all happen in town (no long travel to move), but we have confirmed community spread. 

Anyway, with pets this is going to be tricky if we can’t find a home to buy and close on it before we have to be out. There’s a lot of legwork to do and the pandemic makes it more complicated. We need to rent a storage unit, because we may need to move into a really small place while we House hunt if we haven’t found anything by our move out date. We need to look into potential short term rentals. We need to meet with lenders and real estate agents. We need to tour homes. We need to hire movers to move our big stuff. Obviously we’ll be doing as much of this virtually as we can, but man...talk about timing, huh? Staying in our current home is 100% not an option so we’ll just have to deal.

Soap, some disinfectants are all in stock

Hand sanitizer and antibacterial wipes (not lysol wipes) come in stock infrequently with limited quantities

Lysol spray is impossible to get. I had an order of Microban disinfectant spray get cancelled over the weekend after they had stock at time of my order. This is my #1 desired commodity right now since I want to use it to disinfect soft surfaces. I don't know if they're still making this stuff or why it's been out of stock for over a month now. Literally nobody has it.

Lysol wipes or any such wipes are also impossible to get. Like the spray, I don't know if they're making it. This can be a diy item.

Masks, kiss goodbye for at least 6 months. Everybody is ramping up production to get n95 masks but priority will be Healthcare, first responders, etc (rightfully so). I read that during the pandemic a least 2.5 BILLION n95s will be needed.

991,Another post on the importance of physical fitness,"I have spinal lordosis (my spine is misshapen) which makes it very hard for me to maintain good posture and makes me more likely to suffer from back pain. That said, I've always been physically active and light, two factors that prevent the occurrence of back pain. Five weeks ago I stopped going to the gym. Four weeks ago I stopped going to work and so my 45 minute walks to and from my office also stopped. Since then I've been working from home, sometimes from bed or the couch and without maintaining good posture. I still go on walks, but they're shorter and I haven't been working out at home. I've also been gardening a ton (shoveling dirt, lifting pots, bending over to seed rows etc). 

Well yesterday it happened: I threw out my back. That's all it took: five weeks of not keeping up with good physical fitness and a little added strain. I'm in a lot of pain and lying on an ice pack.  I'm lucky that my husband is also home and can take care of me for a few days until I can move more freely but holy cow, I did not see this coming. I'm in my early 30s and I guess I was feeling cocky about being generally healthy. 

Take home message: during lockdown you are going to lose all of the opportunities for movement that are built in to every day life.

993,How would you prep for a COVID test?,"My mom lives in a different country and has been feeling extremely sick the last couple weeks with COVID-19 symptoms.

She's very high risk so going to the hospital would have been too risky. Instead,her oncologist had her do a chest xray to rule out pneumonia (came back clear) and then sent her home to self isolate and ride it out until a home test was available. Someone is finally coming to her house tomorrow to give her the test. 

I'm worried that, on the chance she doesn't have it, being exposed to a person who is doing COVID tests all day is a bad idea for her. Also not a good situation for the tech administering the test.

What would you do to prep if you were her? 

So far I have the following ideas:

- Set up a table in the garage and have the technician come in through the garage door.

- Remain 6ft away from tech while receiving instructions and asking questions, and until moment of test.

- Wear surgical mask (no n95), gloves and sunglasses the whole time, only remove mask at moment of test.

- Do not touch anything being handled by the tech or the table around it.

- Hold breath, close mouth and eyes for duration of test.

- Go back inside immediately. Close garage door from inside the house once tech is done gathering his kit and leave everything there untouched for at least a week.

- Avoid touching face and remove all gear/clothing into washing machine.

I have prepped for covid19 starting last month. (I was a little late but am pretty happy with what I have.) I have enough toilet paper for 6 months and am not sure exactly how long my food will last, but it's a decent stash.

Now that things are getting really hairy, I'd like to supplement my supply and am finding some items hard to find online (or the prices have gone *really* up). I've been staying at home for over two weeks so I won't be venturing out to grocery stores.

About 6-7 years ago I bought some of those large tins from the ""preparedness"" online stores. (I was in a prepping mood after listening to too much talk radio, lol.) The tins got shifted around over the years and never used. Today I decided to take a better inventory of what I had, and OH MY GOSH! There's a LOT of great stuff there! Probably 15-20 large tins of important staples (vegetables, fruit, bread, eggs, etc).

When I bought the tins I was kind of given a hard time about it by family members, but now I'm *so glad* I have them. I *hoped* I'd never ""have"" to use them, but I guess the time is now. It feels surreal that it's come to this. I thank God that I have them.

996,My husband and I had 'that talk',"..  you know, the one about if one of us should die, or if we both died.  We're both old enough to be concerned.  Our will has been in place for years and doesn't need changing.

As I requested, he put together a list of all our financial stuff, including autopay items that may need to be turned off.  Passwords to his computer, safe combination (I have them, but he included it in one easy to find document), etc.  Real estate stuff (we own multiple properties).  Our thoughts as to the best way for the surviving spouse to handle selling off personal and real property.  That kind of fun stuff.

He has an 'essential job' in a health care business (hospital/clinic), and although he's been working from home as much as he can, some tasks simply must be performed on-site.  I'm able to be much more self-isolating, so I told him that if I came down with this crap, I didn't blame him.  He's doing his best to continue to support us financially, the work he does is critical, and I know that he's being as cautious as possible.

Unfortunately, but realistically, this is a prep all of us should be doing, regardless of the size of your family or how old you are.  If you've never done a will, do one.  If you have children, discuss guardianship and get the agreement of the person/people you choose.  Put it all in writing.

1010,Denied Access during this pandemic! WTF,"The store manager of Walmart 2315 in Dallas Oregon is on one hell of a freaking power trip.
Long story short, my husband was an associate for 20 years with Walmart, and was terminated for sharing a Rodney Carrington video through instant messager on his day off.  Almost a year later he was ""banned"" from shopping in that store but they wouldn't state their reasons why even after multiple requests. They just sent a registered letter with no explanation. 
Our tiny town has 1 Walmart, 1 Safeway, and 1 Grocery Outlet. There are just some items that only Walmart carries. The next closest one is about 17 miles each way and out of our way.

He looked me dead in the eyes and said ""I appreciate your situation but we just can't help you. "" he then suggested I come in on Tuesdays at 6am for the special shopping hour. Um, I am on bed rest.

I hear her telling people on the phone that this is “natures way of reducing the population” and that it’s “survival of the fittest” which doesn’t even make sense.

1031,Bean pot ..,"Two people asked me about beans ( u/gladysk and u/FuriousMaine ), so I thought I'd throw together a post on it.

So what I eat you could call beans, or stew, or soup, because those things are basically all the same thing to me ... a bunch of stuff cooked together that is eaten from a bowl with a spoon, and is yummy.

I am only writing about the crock pot version of this because I think it would have the most interest because of its accessibility, but in the winter I cook on a wood stove which is completely different, and I also often cook over a fire outdoors, and that's different too.

The basic concept here is to make a bean pot or stew pot, or ""forever stew"" or whatever you want to call it, wherein you put ingredients together in a crock pot and put it on its lowest setting a basically let it cook for days.  It typically takes a day to get to the point that it is good enough to eat, and after a few days its the most amazing thing you'll ever eat, and after about 5 days it will start to take on a slightly burnt taste and it'll be time to start over.  You can alter this process by emptying the crockpot out and ""saving"" the product in the refrigerator, heating it up to eat ""leftovers"", etc, but I much prefer just letting everything cook because the longer it cooks (to the point of taking on a burnt taste) the better it tastes.

Beans are the main ingredient in this for me, and I soak them first overnight and rinse them before tossing them in, but other ingredients I like are hand made dumplings, root vegetables, chicken, green beans, herbs, but really as long as it doesn't have a bunch of sugar in it I'll put just about anything in the pot, which has including such bizarre things as a burger king double cheeseburger, and nuggets from chick-fil-a.  In the end it doesn't matter much because it cooks so long that everything just comes together to be a delicious soupy stew.  Essentially anything you cook for that long falls apart and comes together into something new.

My process is super simple, toss it all in with water, let it slow cook for about a day, then start using a ladle to put it into a bowl and eat until I get my fill, then put in new ingredients and more water, and let it keep cooking.  For me this is about a week long activity, just day after day, add new and different ingredients, and keep eating it, it's something I literally never get tired of.

The enemy is that it can take on a burnt taste, which will happen after a variable amount of time but usually around day 5 or 6.  You can extend this period of time by leaving less in the pot before adding new ingredients, or by reducing the size of your crockpot so there is less in it when you are adding more ingredients, and it helps to not add things with a lot of sugar because that seems to make it start tasting burnt faster.  The only other ""bad thing"" about it is that the whole area is going to smell like the best smelling food ever, all the time.

1.). Seeds.  We have outdated seeds, three years old, opened, were kept in a garage in a plastic Tupperware type container.  Peas, snap peas, green beans, parsley, few others.  Are they grow if planted?  Will dry beans that are food grow if planted (not sold as seeds but as dry beans in grocery store)?   

2.). We’ve been spraying down our mail in the mailbox before we even take it out, then we spray each piece.  We ran out of Lysol disinfectant spray.  We also spray our shoes and door before we enter.  Is there any make-it-yourself spray that can be sprayed in the air and on objects that will kill Coronavirus?  We have bleach, one bottle of 91%, a bottle of peroxide.   Bleach wouldn’t be a wise choice, but if we mix alcohol and peroxide can this be sprayed in air too to kill germs as well as sprayed on mail and other objects?

3.). Will spraying down all produce with straight 91% alcohol kill the Coronavirus?  Potatoes, oranges, bananas, whole pineapple, onions, melons, and other firm skinned produce? 

Another ? if you don’t mind...

1050,I’m in northern NJ in a suburb of NYC. For the first time I am unable to obtain a grocery delivery slot.,"We currently have a three month supply of basically everything. I’m not worried about going hungry, but about once a week I’ve been staying up until midnight for the next day’s delivery options to be added on at our local grocery store to 1) replenish what we use and keep a rolling 3 month supply and 2) keep fresh produce, milk, yogurt, etc on hand and 3) maintain a sense of normalcy for my children through all of this. Yesterday I tried to add items to a delivery I have coming today. Shoprite’s website was so bogged down I was literally unable to change anything after multiple attempts and about an hour and a half of my time. I joined shipt and added a cart through them for another store and instacart for a warehouse store. If anyone has any tips on how to get new delivery dates/times for any of these options I would love to know, even if you message me. Instacart just says “We’re sorry, all shoppers are busy for today. Please check back later and try placing your order earlier in the day to pick the best same-day delivery options.”  I don’t need same day. How do I view future dates? I don’t care if it’s 2 weeks out, but I’d love a way to continue securing food coming in. Shipt says there are no delivery times available but they’re working on it. I stayed up until midnight and checked all three options but no new delivery times were available.  I don’t have proper protection and I don’t want to risk going into any stores.

Prior to this I have stockpiled mostly skincare (some folks will get this) and toiletries but since joining this community I’ve dove deep into the art and psychology of prepping, especially now that I run the kitchen. Perhaps my past of poverty while being Asian, but newly independent and anxious, has rekindled this flame.

The transition to strictly eating at home was surprisingly an easy one as cooking is fairly new to me and has yet to lose its novelty. We’ve chosen this unanimously for budget, convenience, and safety reasons but I do wish I could support my beloved mom and pop restaurants (I am still nursing the guilt). I am the only one of my social circles that seems to be almost completely locked down.

1066,Arts and Crafts for the Apocalypse: The Ghetto Autoclave,"This is for when you still have running water and power, but no access to a laundry machine due to quarantine or mechanical breakdown. You’re going to autoclave (or steam clean) a hand towel (that you are bathing or washing your hands with) so you can use it for a few more days without it smelling like your body odour.

You will need a pie-wrex measuring cup, a used (but unsoiled) foot square hand towel (that is not sentimental), an electric kettle or microwave (if you use a microwave you’ll need a second measuring cup), and optionally a binder clip.

Heat up some water to boiling in your kettle or microwave. Fold your hand towel so that one corner is on the top. Squish it into your (empty and dry) cup with the corner opposite the handle and top it with boiling water from the kettle or microwaved measuring cup. You need the whole towel to be wet and preferably under the water line. Let it steep for a few minutes.

Pour out some of the hot water until you can grasp the top corner and optionally clip a binder to that corner to make it easier to hold. When you pull the hand towel out, flip the corner up on top of where the handle meets the cup. This will help you hold it due to being so hot. Pour off the water. Even if your hand cloth is well used, colour will drain from it, so don’t drink it. Pull the towel up out of the cup but keep the bottom in the cup, it’ll be steaming well. Pour off some more water and leave the towel to steam in the cup. Take the binder clip off. The steam will kill more germs than if it was merely underwater.

After a few minutes, the towel should be cool enough to handle. Wring it out (more colour may come out), and hang dry. Now you’ve bought yourself a few days of not having to use another towel. Wash the cup immediately.

It is ill advised to try to cook your wet hand towel in the microwave, as there is a risk of fire.

Don’t put your nice coffee mug in the microwave, it makes it harder to clean burnt milk off and after enough trips it will crack. Where the handle meets the mug is always the cracking point because it is always dry. Use the measuring cup instead, it has much less sentimental value and less likely to crack.

You can also spray your hand towel with vinegar and let it air out before ghetto autoclaving it to make it smell fresher.",PandemicPreps,1586045906,ce34d7b7,1,1,True,2020-04-04 17:18:26,still running water power access laundry machine due quarantine mechanical breakdown going autoclave steam clean hand towel bathing washing hands use days without smelling like body odour need pie wrex measuring cup used unsoiled foot square hand towel sentimental electric kettle microwave use microwave need second measuring cup optionally binder clip water boiling kettle microwave fold hand towel one corner top squish empty dry cup corner opposite handle top boiling water kettle microwaved measuring cup need whole towel wet preferably water line let steep minutes hot water grasp top corner optionally clip binder corner make easier hold pull hand towel flip corner top handle meets cup help hold due hot pour water even hand cloth well used colour drain drink pull towel cup keep bottom cup steaming well pour water leave towel steam cup take binder clip steam kill germs merely underwater minutes towel cool enough handle wring colour may come hang dry bought days use another towel wash cup immediately ill advised try cook wet hand towel microwave risk fire put nice coffee mug microwave makes harder clean burnt milk enough trips crack handle meets mug always cracking point always dry use measuring cup instead much less sentimental value less likely crack also spray hand towel vinegar let air ghetto autoclaving make smell fresher,still run water power access laundri machin due quarantin mechan breakdown go autoclav steam clean hand towel bath wash hand use day without smell like bodi odour need pie wrex measur cup use unsoil foot squar hand towel sentiment electr kettl microwav use microwav need second measur cup option binder clip water boil kettl microwav fold hand towel one corner top squish empti dri cup corner opposit handl top boil water kettl microwav measur cup need whole towel wet prefer water line let steep minut hot water grasp top corner option clip binder corner make easier hold pull hand towel flip corner top handl meet cup help hold due hot pour water even hand cloth well use colour drain drink pull towel cup keep bottom cup steam well pour water leav towel steam cup take binder clip steam kill germ mere underwat minut towel cool enough handl wring colour may come hang dri bought day use anoth towel wash cup immedi ill advis tri cook wet hand towel microwav risk fire put nice coffe mug microwav make harder clean burnt milk enough trip crack handl meet mug alway crack point alway dri use measur cup instead much less sentiment valu less like crack also spray hand towel vinegar let air ghetto autoclav make smell fresher

1084,The True Ventilator Situation in America,"I'm sorry if this isn't the right subreddit to post this in but I follow everyone's posts here and have been a prepper for a little over a year now. But I have to get this out to everyone so they know how bad this situation is in Ohio and I have a feeling this isn't isolated just to Ohio.

Dr. Amy Acton signed a bill on March 30th that has all hospitals in the state of Ohio report weekly how many ventilators they currently have available. However, if you read the whole order, she changed the definition of a ventilator to mean various pieces of equipment in our hospitals, including a weak nasal cannula which hospitals have at least 50 or so laying around. So when hospitals are to report the number of ""ventilators"" they have, that number is higher than the truth. 

Why is that? I have a few theories on why but the most obvious one is the gov't is trying to hide the fact we don't have enough ventilators to save everyone and they don't want to cause mass panic.

I work at a hospital they named yesterday that's taking care of the Elkton Federal Prison's infected inmates and now we will run out of life-saving supplies before our predicted surge was even supposed to occur. And because we are reporting false high numbers of our ventilators, we will be overlooked by the National Government when they have ventilators in their national stockpile available.

My local news stations have talked to me, clearly interested in what I have to say, then...nothing. It's not on the news, no one has brought it up to the Govenor's daily press conferences, nothing. 

The picture I've included is the excerpt from Dr. Acton's order that redefines the definition of a ventilator and what it all includes now.",PandemicPreps,1586271973,PeppersMomma,63,3,True,2020-04-07 08:06:13,sorry right subreddit post follow everyone posts prepper little year get everyone know bad situation ohio feeling isolated ohio amy acton signed bill march th hospitals state ohio report weekly many ventilators currently available however read whole order changed definition ventilator mean various pieces equipment hospitals including weak nasal cannula hospitals least laying around hospitals report number ventilators number higher truth theories obvious one gov trying hide fact enough ventilators save everyone want cause mass panic work hospital named yesterday taking care elkton federal prison infected inmates run life saving supplies predicted surge even supposed occur reporting false high numbers ventilators overlooked national government ventilators national stockpile available local news stations talked clearly interested say nothing news one brought govenor daily press conferences nothing picture included excerpt dr acton order redefines definition ventilator includes,sorri right subreddit post follow everyon post prepper littl year get everyon know bad situat ohio feel isol ohio ami acton sign bill march th hospit state ohio report weekli mani ventil current avail howev read whole order chang definit ventil mean variou piec equip hospit includ weak nasal cannula hospit least lay around hospit report number ventil number higher truth theori obviou one gov tri hide fact enough ventil save everyon want caus mass panic work hospit name yesterday take care elkton feder prison infect inmat run life save suppli predict surg even suppos occur report fals high number ventil overlook nation govern ventil nation stockpil avail local news station talk clearli interest say noth news one brought govenor daili press confer noth pictur includ excerpt dr acton order redefin definit ventil includ

1086,"While quarantined, please be careful with your food intake and stay healthy. The hospitals in my country are reporting a disturbing trend between obesity and ICU admission that's out of line with demographic weight distributions.","I get it and I've been reading a lot about you all having issues with this in the comments. You're at home and it's a disturbing, stressful time. Food is a comfort to many, if not simply a habitual thing that's tied to simply being at home. That being said: *please* make sure you watch your food intake and stay healthy everyone.. It's so easy to gain weight without even noticing it in a situation like this and in the case of COVID-19, it *seems* (nothing conclusive yet to be fair, but plenty of signs pointing in that direction) that abdominal fat itself has an aggravating role in how the illness develops. 

In my country (the Netherlands) several hospitals have now reported that a very high percentage (&gt;80%, sometimes even &gt;90%) of their ICU patients are obese (average BMI 30). For reference (data from 2019), in my country, ~35% of people are overweight (BMI 25-30) and ~15% of people are obese (BMI &gt;30). This number is more or less the same for senior (&gt;65 y.o.) women, though senior men are on general a bit heavier at ~50% being overweight (and still 15% being obese). The numbers they are seeing at the ICU are definitely not in line with how overweight the general public is.

I posted (and translated the article in comments) about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fwm7zy/having_a_lot_of_abdominal_fat_is_bad_news_if_you/) on the r/coronavirus sub. It's a follow up interview with the ICU director who first noticed the trend between his COVID-19 patients being exceedingly more obese than his regular ICU patients. He discusses how adipose fat itself is hypothesized to worsen infection outcomes if you're interested.

We are in it for the long haul here people.. This situation will likely take *months* to resolve, so make sure you focus on your quarantine diet being maintainable for that time frame!

I documented my approach in attempting to help with the shortage of Filtering Facepiece Respirators. I came across the same articles and papers many of the interested parties have come across and decided to try my hand at building an enclosure to test efficacy. I wanted to share my work here.

1093,Two Krogers in one day- SE Michigan,"I had been down to once a week re-ups at the grocery store, but today, I went to a different Kroger than I usually do, and they did not have a significant number of things I was looking for. As I am extending time between my grocery runs (went to 8 days this time, going to shoot for 9 now,) I decided to put on new gloves and continue using my mask, and hit another my usual spot. Figured I would share my observations.

First Kroger: Did not have many items on my list, including: a specific style of tuna fish my family prefers, an easter cereal my son asked for, Heinz ketchup, a specific brand of sliced peaches, virtually all coca-cola soda varieties, bakery croissants, lactose-free whole milk, refrigerated sour cream and chives mashed potatoes, hot dog buns, minced garlic except for organic, and toilet paper.

It was fairly crowded. Most of the employees were masked and gloved, though not all. They had added shields directly in front of the register for the cashiers. There are signs on the floor, making aisles ""one way"", but everyone ignored them. Grr. Probably 80% of customers were wearing masks. Out of alcohol wipes, but an employee on the way in sprayed down my cart's handle.

Second Kroger: Still did not have some needed items, including the tuna, the ketchup, the seasonal cereal, and toilet paper.

MUCH less crowded, but also fewer registers open. 70%+ customers wearing masks, fewer of the employees masked up. Also had the guard plastic at the registers, also had the seemingly invisible ""one way aisle"" signs on the floors. Out of alcohol wipes, no employee offering to spray carts.

BOTH stores had some yeast. I forgot to check flour. Well stocked, except the TP. Talked to one of the cashiers and she reiterated that they get trucks in daily, but have no idea what will be on the trucks.

At the first store, my cart was literally overloaded, and I had someone ask if I had enough stuff. I replied not really, I have a family of 6 and trying to go to the store less than once a week. He then agreed I didn't have enough, and empathized about kids always being hungry.

1101,Can I Get Your Input on My Bugging In Plans?,"I would appreciate some advice from my fellow preppers.

But first some background. I have been prepping since February and have stockpiled enough food and supplies for about a year. My wife and I have not left the house for about 3 weeks except for 1 supply run where my wife went to the store for fresh vegetables wearing a mask.

My wife is a teacher and schools are closed here till at least September. I own a business and have been working from home, though my employees are upset that I have left them in danger, dealing with the public and have expressed their displeasure to me. They tell me that me not being there makes them feel I have abandoned them and that they are risking their lives; they say they are stressed. 

So here is the dilemma. Our Canadian province has less than 200 confirmed cases. The actual number is admitted to be greater, but they have been testing and doing contact tracing so it is probably not that much greater. Even an order 20 times greater would bring it to 4000 in a population of about 1.5 million. 

We can be grateful that our province acted proactively to slow the spread. When we had the first 11 cases we forbade public gatherings of more than 10 people, almost everyone who can is working from home. All non essential travel has been banned. We also shut everything down for 2 weeks including non essential businesses. My business is deemed essential and has not closed. Unless something changes non essential businesses will also reopen April 13.

I had expected that when this virus hit our area it would be fast moving and fairly apocalyptic but so far our health system is managing. We have had very few deaths or even hospitalizations, yet I see the tragedy in Italy and New York and wonder if this is just the quiet before the storm. Plus the rest of Canada has a lot more cases. 

So the dilemma I face is do I follow through to basically quarantine myself for a year, or do I go back to work like nothing is happening.

1105,If you wear a mask or respirator in public,"This is my small plea to everyone wearing masks in public.  I’m an essential worker &amp; had to go to grocery store after my shift yesterday.  The last few times I’ve been out, I’ve noticed people are wearing masks more, but this also seems to be causing some concerning behavior that’s becoming more widespread/common.  This applies to fabric masks, N95s, and respirators.

A lot of people are wearing masks incorrectly - often intentionally, it would seem.  The mask should cover your nose, not be worn *under* your nose or just barely hanging on the very end of your nose (so you can “get some air”).  

Yes, masks are hot, uncomfortable, and the best (worst) way to discover you *really* need a tic-tac.  However, not wearing it correctly is exactly the same as not wearing one at all.

It should fit tightly against the face, over the nose and mouth, with no gaps when you move or talk.  

Do not loosen your mask or pull your mask down/off to talk, cough, or sneeze.  Don’t touch, fidget, or adjust your mask after you’ve put it on.  Adjustment/placement is done when you initially put it on, not while standing in the bread aisle.  The mask is considered to be contaminated, and now you’ve just fiddled with it and gone on to put your contaminated hands on fresh produce or opened several cartons checking eggs.

Just because you’re wearing a mask does not mean you don’t have to social distance anymore.  A mask does not turn you into an invincible Marvel (or DC) superhero.  Still stay 6ft away from people.  If someone at the store is at a shelf you need to get at, stand back and patiently wait for them to move or politely say “excuse me” to get their attention &amp; give them a chance to step aside before walking up to get what you need &amp; moving on.  Both of these work very well.  Don’t get all up in someone’s personal space to reach something - that wasn’t acceptable behavior before, and it’s certainly not acceptable now.  

All this applies if your child is wearing a mask as well.  I’ve seen far too many kids in public wearing loose/ill-fitting masks or mom/dad/whoever allowing them to wear it under their nose, because it wasn’t comfortable.  If you’re concerned enough for them to wear a mask, then please have them wear it correctly.",PandemicPreps,1586533599,Friendly-Raspberry,107,1,True,2020-04-10 08:46:39,small plea everyone wearing masks public essential worker go grocery store shift yesterday last times noticed people wearing masks also seems causing concerning behavior becoming widespread common applies fabric masks n respirators lot people wearing masks incorrectly often intentionally would seem mask cover nose worn nose barely hanging end nose get air masks hot uncomfortable best worst way discover really need tic tac however wearing correctly exactly wearing one fit tightly face nose mouth gaps move talk loosen mask pull mask talk cough sneeze touch fidget adjust mask put adjustment placement done initially put standing bread aisle mask considered contaminated fiddled gone put contaminated hands fresh produce opened several cartons checking eggs wearing mask mean social distance anymore mask turn invincible marvel dc superhero still stay ft away people someone store shelf need get stand back patiently wait move politely say excuse get attention give chance step aside walking get need moving work well get someone personal space reach something acceptable behavior certainly acceptable applies child wearing mask well seen far many kids public wearing loose ill fitting masks mom dad whoever allowing wear nose comfortable concerned enough wear mask please wear correctly,small plea everyon wear mask public essenti worker go groceri store shift yesterday last time notic peopl wear mask also seem caus concern behavior becom widespread common appli fabric mask n respir lot peopl wear mask incorrectli often intent would seem mask cover nose worn nose bare hang end nose get air mask hot uncomfort best worst way discov realli need tic tac howev wear correctli exactli wear one fit tightli face nose mouth gap move talk loosen mask pull mask talk cough sneez touch fidget adjust mask put adjust placement done initi put stand bread aisl mask consid contamin fiddl gone put contamin hand fresh produc open sever carton check egg wear mask mean social distanc anymor mask turn invinc marvel dc superhero still stay ft away peopl someon store shelf need get stand back patient wait move polit say excus get attent give chanc step asid walk get need move work well get someon person space reach someth accept behavior certainli accept appli child wear mask well seen far mani kid public wear loos ill fit mask mom dad whoever allow wear nose comfort concern enough wear mask pleas wear correctli

1109,"Suggestion: If you have prepped with N95 cloth masks, N95 cartridge respirators, surgical masks, etc., now is the time you should be wearing them...","After following this virus closely since Jan 23, I believe we're at the point now where a majority of the population of the US is infected (including asymptomatic carriers).  

I think that the infection rate is likely 75 to 100% for:

* police
* medical workers (nurses, doctors, EMS/ambulance, receptionists)
* cashiers at most retail stores

Back when you were prepping for a pandemic a year ago or a month or two ago, and you got your hands on some *effective* masks, this is what you were prepping for.

Best bet is to stay home, but if your food supplies are running out and you absolutely *have* to go to a store, this would be the time to wear your mask in public.  Not next week, not next month, not this fall, but starting now.

And as others have posted, don't let anyone guilt you into believing you should be donating these items you purchased to hospitals.

1111,The most important thing I’ve learned,"I started prepping about two months ago. I was given crap by family members, got in arguments with my boyfriend, etc. but I kept on plowing through thanks to the support from all of you. Thank goodness.

The most important thing I’ve learned from all of you is: buy more than what you need for just yourself because you will need share with those in need.

I was able to buy some n95 masks, gave some to my parents, and they have been generous with them. They gave one to an elderly neighbor of theirs who was so thankful. He left a message on my parents phone and my parents couldn’t wait to call me and play his message for me. He was so thankful that he could go to the store and get the items he needed because he had a little bit of extra protection. It was hard not to tear up listening to what he had to say and how thankful he was.

We are smart, we think ahead, we protect ourselves and our loved ones. We also help others knowing that we might not get “credit” or get our “money back” but it’s not about that. We need to be there for people, taking care of ourselves and family first of course. (And you still need to be somewhat secretive of qtys you have) But I thank you all for the advice.

1113,Grocery Store Report from Ohio,"I went to a Giant Eagle yesterday. They were not enforcing anything. They had a sign at the door saying that 500 people were allowed in the store. While Walmart down the street only allowed 50 people in a time. Nobody in the store was following social distancing. I was giving people dirty looks as they walked right by me. I spent like a minute looking at pasta, ten people walked right behind me in the one minute. Talked to customer service, told me that they couldn't do anything. And the stickers that they have people stand on to wait in line for the checkouts are clearly not six feet apart. Couples were in there with their babies, little kids, even groups of elderly people were together. I saw a group of six people who look like to me weren't even in the same family with a single cart. 

And in our state they started limiting how many people can be in the store at a time. And I highly doubt that 500 people is 20 percent capacity in a store smaller than Walmart. Or even 50 percent capacity. I'm just fuming. And never want to set foot in a store again. I don't care if I don't have anything to eat or take a shower with. Not risking it at all.

1114,"If you shop, please read this.","I'm a cashier in a grocery store.  Please assume everything you buy right now is potentially contaminated.  We have customers come in and they shop like they always have, picking things up and then putting them back down.  It's probable that none or almost none of these people have Covid-19, but we're supposed to be behaving as if they do.  Also, those people go through one of a very few registers and my colleagues and I handle hundreds of orders a day.  We're cleaning like crazy - to the point that the credit card terminals are ""cranky"" because of the increase in moisture level.  But we can't sterilize our hands or the registers.  
      Also, it's six of one, half a dozen of the other when it comes to using self checkout.  They aren't cleaned between every customer; at busy times we just can't do that.  So those touch screens get pretty nasty.  And with the plexiglass barriers you have very little contact with a cashier.  As far as I know I'm the only cashier at my store wearing a mask.  Our store isn't providing them although there's a rumor they might soon.  Several of us wear gloves, but we can't change them between each customer (I can't afford to) though I try to use sanitizer on my gloves regularly.  We want you to stay healthy while we stay healthy.  I personally have a child at home with asthma and am terrified of taking this disease home to him.

1117,Pandemic laundry for apartment dwellers,"If you (like me) have the misfortune of living in an apartment during this pandemic and do not have your own laundry I thought I would share some tips to wash and dry your clothes at home. 

Hand washing you’re clothes is a laborious task but I’d rather do that than use a laundry room that 40-50 different families use. I’ve had the gray water from other peoples washes back up on my clothes before. (Ew) 

Here is a few things to consider buying that make the task easier 

1. Spin dryer - if you aren’t familiar with these they are fabulous. I was on the fence about buying one but I wanted a way to wash clothes at home. I couldn’t hand wrong the towels very well and it caused a headache. After getting one of these, even hanging indoors my towels dry in 2-3 hours instead of days. Most clothes dry in 30 minutes - 2 hours even indoors. 

2. Lysol laundry sanitizer - laundry sanitizer is essential for us because my husband works in healthcare. Being able to sanitize our clothes in the wash makes up for the fact that I am not using a dryer which would normally kill most of the bacteria and viruses. 

3. Get creative about where you can hang a line indoors - if you’re worried about someone coughing and a virus landing on your clothes you can hang them indoors to dry. I have several lines in my bedroom. It’s not ideal but I’m able to keep up with the laundry of 5 people. 

4. Doing all of this saves money 💰- We typically spent $80-100 on laundry every month. That’s money you could be spending on preps or saving. I actually created this system when I was looking to get out of debt and was cutting corners wherever I could to pay it off faster. 

If you have laundry tips please leave a comment.

1136,Security Cameras,"Do you guys have any suggestions for outdoor security cameras that have no fees or give you atleast a few days worth of free cloud storage?

I've seen some offer 7 days, others 48 hours and some 24 hours. 

Then the issue is: how free and open source are they?  If they at any point decided to limit their services or shut down would you be capable of using it with a dvr/nvr or straight to your own cloud based storage elsewhere?  Does it have a slot for an sd card as a backup? If not I would be left with a paperweight.

Then there comes the issue of wifi cameras.  Signal issues, recording corruption, charging.  There have also been thieves that specifically steal these cameras because of how easily they can dismount them.

Another issue is trusting them on your network.  We have seen stories of how televisions and cameras on your network are a security risk but most people do this.  People using default passwords on security cameras or not using 2 factor authentication.  But is this enough?

Can I trust Wyze cameras on my network?  Can I trust ubiquiti or other propitiatory services to completely manage my networking if I want to separate networks?

It seems one would require a lot of know-how to set up their own network with separate vlans and to have their raspberry-pi based camera uploading to their own encrypted cloud service if they truly wanted to be secure.

Then there are indoor cameras preferably ones with an sd slot.  Which obviously shouldn't have any bluetooth, wifi capabilities whatsoever.  But with these come the issue of the possible theft of the nvr/dvr you're recording it on to.  Which would mean hiding it and locking it up.

I am emailing the landlord and asking her to please make sure he is wearing a mask and gloves and taking precautions, but that will only go so far as I can not control proper glove usage and he will probably not be wearing shoe-guards, and he will have to enter three other units as well.

I will be removing all rugs and small furniture out of the area to make clean up easier after he is done. I will be wearing a mask while he is inside and sanitize floors/doors afterward. Should I open all of the windows as well? I am afraid he will cough or breathe hard enough (he is a smoker) that it will not only be the immediate area that would possibly be contaminated. Also, my house is tiny so he will have to go in the front door which leads into the kitchen and the closet he needs is in the dining/living room. 

I am thinking of putting up a partition blocking the kitchen (cutting up a trash bag? Finally putting to use all of the bubble wrap film I have saved?) but is that too much and then should I do the same for around the closet/into the dining and living room?

March 1 - 5: insanely achey feeling as if I’d been lifting weights, especially a tight ache in my chest muscles. No energy, brain fog (forgetting words and just feeling out of it). No cough no fever.

March 22 - now: My temperature slowly crept down and ever since, once in a while I feel like my lungs are asthmatic and itchy but other than that things have gone back to normal. 

Meanwhile, my boyfriend ended up with the asthmatic itchy cough/tight chest feeling around the same time as me and still gets it once in a while, but never the aches nor the fever.

I'm curious if there's any way I can safely put some other filtration material in lieu of the filters, or just on top of the filters. Ideally I'd like to not poison myself doing this, and in a perfect world it would actually be effective at keeping me and others safe. Normally I'd go and order filters that covered use, but naturally those are out of stock as far as I've seen (go figure). 

In any case, if you could help, I'm mainly looking for three things:

I need to move around a lot so I come into very close distance with a crowd of customers in the bank.

* Should I wear two surgical masks on top of one another or the fake cloth mask only? Or should I wear a surgical mask beneath or above this cloth mask? 

* How do I sip water from my steel flask during the day when I am at my desk? What procedure do I need to follow in order to doff my mask and sip water and then don the mask again? Keep in mind that I am wearing handgloves which might already be contaminated and might cross-contaminate the bottle mouth when opening and I cannot remove the gloves because its disposable and I only get 2 pairs. 

* How do I use the bathroom? If I go to the bathroom 4 times a day, again I cannot take off the glvoes and wear them again or dispose of them. What to do in this case? 

* When eating lunch, suppose my work clothes (a dress shirt, dress shoes, dress trousers) are contaminated. Do I need to do anything else before eating lunch? 

* If I sneeze or cough in my mask, how do I clean it? 

* How do I scratch my face or nose with the mask on?

1205,Important lesson to take away ... it's hard to prep DURING the emergency.,"It's an important lesson to take away from all of this, and that is that once the emergency has started, it's very hard to complete your preps.

Example, think of something simple that you want to do right now, maybe install a mobile radio, or put up a fence, or start a garden, and how much harder it is now than it would have been a year ago.  It's hard to get materials, hard to get people to help even if you pay well, etc.  Imagine if there was a war, or a nuclear event, and you wanted to do those things ... what if Amazon wasn't shipping at all, what if there was no hardware store.  Then it becomes the world's least enjoyable scavenger hunt ... that exact bolt you needed with the right threads, the gauge of wire you need in the length you need, the tool you have to have to do the job, ... all these little things that can together make it incredibly hard to complete any project, but that could have been really easy if you had done it when times are good.

It's not just whether you can afford the parts, materials, tools, etc, .. but whether they even exist anywhere near you, or whether you can even find them.  It isn't like the old days when everyone got the same toaster out of the Sear's catalog and the local service shop knew how to fix them, .. now everyone gets things off the Internet, and you might be the only person in the whole town that has that toaster, and maybe nobody can fix it.  Maybe that add on feature that you thought you'd get ""someday"" is never available to you again.

The only sure way is to get it, install it, learn to use it, so that it becomes a part of your life now when it is relatively easy to do that.  Because nobody knows what tomorrow might bring ... it might be a pandemic where you can't go to the hardware store to get that bolt, or it might be a depression where the shops get boarded up, or it might be a war where the delivery truck stops coming.

Once the SHTF, it might be too late, that prep you wanted to do might be 100x harder, or even impossible to complete.",PandemicPreps,1587683897,Intense_Resolve,40,1,True,2020-04-23 16:18:17,important lesson take away emergency started hard complete preps think something simple want right maybe install mobile radio put fence start garden much harder would year ago hard get materials hard get people help even pay well etc imagine war nuclear event wanted things amazon shipping hardware store becomes world least enjoyable scavenger hunt exact bolt needed right threads gauge wire need length need tool job little things together make incredibly hard complete project could really easy done times good whether afford parts materials tools etc whether even exist anywhere near whether even find like old days everyone got toaster sear catalog local service shop knew fix everyone gets things internet might person whole town toaster maybe nobody fix maybe add feature thought get someday never available sure way get install learn use becomes part life relatively easy nobody knows tomorrow might bring might pandemic go hardware store get bolt might depression shops get boarded might war delivery truck stops coming shtf might late prep wanted might x harder even impossible complete,import lesson take away emerg start hard complet prep think someth simpl want right mayb instal mobil radio put fenc start garden much harder would year ago hard get materi hard get peopl help even pay well etc imagin war nuclear event want thing amazon ship hardwar store becom world least enjoy scaveng hunt exact bolt need right thread gaug wire need length need tool job littl thing togeth make incred hard complet project could realli easi done time good whether afford part materi tool etc whether even exist anywher near whether even find like old day everyon got toaster sear catalog local servic shop knew fix everyon get thing internet might person whole town toaster mayb nobodi fix mayb add featur thought get someday never avail sure way get instal learn use becom part life rel easi nobodi know tomorrow might bring might pandem go hardwar store get bolt might depress shop get board might war deliveri truck stop come shtf might late prep want might x harder even imposs complet

1207,Thoughts on Moving During a Pandemic?,"I live in a city and have two small kids. We live in a single family house and have a yard, but it’s a tiny yard. Houses are very close together. About 8 or 10 feet between my exterior walls and the neighboring houses on either side.  I usually love my neighborhood. Love sitting on the front porch and chatting with people who walk by. Love that our kids all play together in the alley and at the park down the block instead of alone in private yards. Love walking to restaurants, coffee shops, ice cream shop, kids activities, the grocery store, etc... Love taking the train downtown.

As you can imagine, all of those “loves” are now liabilities. It’s nice to have social interaction chatting with neighbors from opposite sides of the street, but people walking by on the sidewalk are barely 6 feet from me and my kids if we are on the porch, and everything else we love is on pause for quite a while. It’s hard to imagine feeling safe taking a crowded train again for a long, long time.

We have the means and flexibility to move out to the suburbs. It would put us closer to aging parents and some other family, and for this reason we considered it even before covid. We could have a big yard and perhaps a little more indoor space too. A swing set and a sandbox to replace the public parks that are closed for the foreseeable future. A big vegetable garden. Room for a bigger deep freezer, too.

I’ve started to think through some of the logistics of moving and how to do it while minimizing risk. But my main concern is if I will miss our neighborhood and regret leaving once this is behind us. I want to make the best decision for my family’s mental and happiness while we get through the pandemic, but not lose sight of the long term. 

How we would meet and get to know new neighbors if we move now? Am I just overreacting to feeling cooped up? Would love your input. So many people I know in real life still seem to think this will be over in another two weeks.

1213,Losing Weight or Losing Breastmilk,"This is such a weird question but can’t think of another community that could help me make a choice! 


I am breastfeeding a toddler and am currently 30 pounds overweight putting me into the obese category. When I first started breastfeeding the baby weight came flying off but I found once I lose  under a certain number my milk supply drops dramatically, I become ravenous and eat constantly until I get those 5-10 pounds back and milk supply becomes more stable. Ive been gaining and losing the same 10 pounds for months. I know the weight will come off once I finally wean her so I wasn’t too upset that I was all gross and fat for a bit longer since I was so happy I could breastfeed at all. I didn’t intend to do extended breastfeeding but my toddler eats very little and their ped and I are slightly concerned about their weight. 


However, we also know that obesity plays a role in how bad COVID-19 is. I am currently quarantining with more vulnerable family members so if we need to leave the house I am the one to do it.  


Another concern is I live firmly in hurricane territory. I like the fact that if the season is bad, we lose power and food were to become more scarce my toddler would at least have some type of nutrition just for them. They are already underweight and a typical picky toddler so their food stash has been a huge source of stress for me through the pandemic

Source of the below is:  /r/supplychain/comments/g76jhh/covid19_update_friday_24th_april/  - this is just an excerpt.  The user who writes these provides some excellent info in his daily updates that could give you a heads up about what the future holds.  For instance it was in his posts that I learned transoceanic shipping from China had come to a standstill, and that's when I went out and prepped for everyday, ordinary things like floss, toothpaste, toothbrushes, anything we use daily that is plastic/imported/made in China, etc.

*Japan only has a 2-week stockpile of LNG (Liquid Natural Gas) - If supplies stop, it will cause major power supply problems in the country says Nikkei’s Asian review which has an article highlighting the continuing energy supply chain vulnerability in Japan ever since the Fukushima nuclear disaster. It takes about one month to ship LNG from the Middle East to Japan explains the article but if the coronavirus outbreak prevents ships from docking in Japan it could have a big impact on the country's power supply. The physical properties of LNG mean it is poorly suited for long-term storage hence the country only holding a two-week stockpile. Despite this, the country depends on the fuel for 40% of its electric power generation needs, and all of the LNG it uses is imported from the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Tokyo Bay, which stretches across the prefectures of Chiba, Tokyo and Kanagawa, is Japan's most important LNG power generation hub. JERA operates many of the power plants there, all of which run on LNG. Accounting for about 30% of Japan's total LNG power generation, these plants produce 26 million kilowatts of electricity. If, for instance, the coronavirus was to force these plants to stop, the Greater Tokyo area would immediately lose its power supply (Personal note: that’s a population of approx 38.5m people).*

*Today, LNG is a pillar of Japan's electricity. Before the March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami in Japan, LNG made up 28% of the country's power generation. That increased to 40% in fiscal 2017 as the nation's nuclear power plants went off grid, one after the other, following the Fukushima nuclear crisis. While some of Japan's nuclear plants have come back online, based on the strictest standards in the world, only three of the 10 electric power companies have been able to do so. Moreover, the coronavirus is inching closer and closer to the nuclear plants. Recently, a contractor working at the Genkai Nuclear Power Plant in the southern prefecture of Saga tested positive for the virus and construction at the site was stopped temporarily. Japan has traditionally tried to maintain a diverse mixture of power sources -- including nuclear, LNG, fossil fuels and renewable energy -- due to its reliance on imports as an island nation. ""It is highly unbalanced to depend close to half of our energy on LNG alone,"" an official at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry concedes. With shipments arriving constantly, a few missed shipments will not immediately signal a crisis. But an extended cutoff will spell trouble for the country.*

*Japan was already facing a power shortage this year, ""so the timing is very bad,"" said a power industry source. The Sendai nuclear power plant in Kagoshima Prefecture was shut down last month because it failed to meet antiterrorism standards. The No. 3 reactor at the Ikata nuclear power plant in Ehime Prefecture is offline following a court injunction. The number of nuclear reactors in operation this year is expected to temporarily fall by half from nine, so Japan cannot rely heavily on nuclear power. Japan's energy self-sufficiency stands at about 10%, well below the 40% for food. The movement to shift away from carbon has led to a backlash against domestic coal-fired power plants, so dependence on LNG could rise further. One reason that Tokyo Electric is rushing to restart its Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant in Niigata Prefecture is because ""heavy concentration in LNG power in Tokyo Bay is a major risk to the stable supply of power,"" according to an official at the utility. The coronavirus pandemic is testing whether Japan's government and utilities can diversify energy sources to prepare against the risks that threaten supplies.*

1221,The tranquility of food security ..,"Few things make you feel as safe and secure as knowing that you have enough food, and the ability to get food, that you aren't going to starve even under really bad circumstances.  It's so wonderful to sit, look at your food stores, and know that you don't have to worry so much about what you're going to eat if the trucks stop running, it kind of makes you feel all warm and happy inside.  Of all the things that people could prepare for the future ... having savings instead of debt, having weapons, having dependable vehicles, fuel, etc ... nothing seems as important as that stockpile of food.  For many, having space to garden, seeds, a means to harvest wild animals for food, etc, gives a similar sense of security, .. but having a good store of food is in itself incredibly comforting.

I know this sounds weird, but I doubt I'm the only person who has ever done this ... just sit and marvel at modern food.  The pop top cans of chunky soup ... meal sized cans of food, sealed up, safe, with an easy to open lid, it's almost incredible that you can have such a thing for less than 2 USD, to hold it and roll it around in your hand and know that you can eat what is inside.  Or running your hands through a bag of sugar, all the little crystals of it sparkling in the light, again, amazing that you can have so much of a thing for so little money.  Or the metal foil that contains two pop tart treats, just tear it off, and eat it.  And yet someday that might not be true, even today, for some items we can't even buy them anymore, if you don't have them already you basically can't get them without paying exorbitant prices.

Food and water are the most basic of human needs, they are literally life itself, in physical form, and like some a miser counting their silver and gold coins, it's extremely satisfying to simply gaze upon your own food stores and feel as wealthy as a prince.  If the world falls apart and the Earth spins through space covered in wars and famine .. at least you have food.  It's the most primal motivation, and I'm glad we live in a world where at least for the moment food is so easy to come by, and that it can be stockpiled for the future.

1223,Eye opening seeing how wasteful my family has been,"This experience has been extremely eye opening as to how wasteful my family has been. Usually dinner leftovers would not be eaten by anyone but me.  Now I’m finding myself repurposing leftovers or freezing them for later.

This week so far I transformed our leftover taco fixings into beef, bean and rice burritos which I froze to make chimichangas with and a batch of make shift enchiladas with. One night of leftovers created 2 fresh new meals for later on.  Made chicken tikka masala and that went into the freezer. If I add a can of drained chickpeas it will be enough to feed us another meal. Made a bbq chicken rice casserole with leftover roasted chicken. We had half leftover so in the freezer it went for another dinner or 2.  Also made American goulash using budgetbyte’s recipe. It made way too much for us but I threw it in the freezer and now have an additional 2 meals for us. So just my regular weekly cooking has produced almost another week of filling, hearty meals for us.  Tonight I’m making meatball subs and that will also produce enough meatballs to put away for another 2 meals. I’ve also been recycling our leftover morning coffee in a big pitcher in the fridge for iced coffee through the day or for frappes.  

I think if I had to say anything positive about this horrible situation is it is really making me see the error of our ways and work hard to correct them. I always knew how to stretch food but I got lazy between work and life. Now that I don’t have income coming in and just my savings and preps to make it I’ve really tightened the belt and plan on definitely keeping it up after this ends.

1227,Sourdough Discard Waffles: A good no-waste recipe,"My timing was off for sourdough baking today. I had to refeed my starter before making bread.  This gave me a lot of discard, so I pulled out my notes about using starter discard.

    2 tablespoons melted butter (I used veg oil because oil makes a crisper waffle)

    1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

    pinch of salt

1228,"Possible(?) scenario ... deflation, depression, devaluation, famine, and war.","No, I'm not a doomer (and yes I know how crazy this is going to sound), but u/ekse1 asked me what I thought might happen in future, so I tried to imagine what I feel is the worst that could happen, because I'd rather prep for worst case and have it not be that bad, than the other way around.

I think this market rally is about done, DJIA 25K maybe, with a selloff after a big up day, maybe in the next few weeks, and grinding into months.  That level is about the support for the previous lows.  People say the stock market isn't the economy, but it is for a lot of middle class people, .. no way everything returns to pre-covid this summer, even after they open restaurants up, I think that will be self-regulated with fear in the public.  Unemployment stays high, we trade into August and September, rates stay low, and we get a much worse crash in the future than we've already had after a retest of the lows made weeks ago.  Oil takes a dump again when the next futures expiration date comes up, the same as it did when this last futures date came up, because it takes a while before all the oil that is already on the ocean clears out and reductions in production take hold.

We're already in recession, and even when they reopen unemployment doesn't drop to the levels it was pre-covid.  Up until now, with the stimulus that went out, this has all been fun and games .. ample food, money with which to buy it, few evictions, etc, but that can't and won't go on for much longer.  For a while it will be relatively bad, unemployment benefits run for 26 weeks and that clock has started ticking already, the alarm will go off in late September, and that's when it gets REALLY interesting for people who have been out of work.  During the summer there will be a good many seasonal jobs that people can still do, which is going to keep unemployment relatively okay compared to what it will be once autumn kicks in and the virus starts biting really hard into Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Retail is dead, the age of unbridled faith in the future fails.

Interest rates stay low, and as the recession really starts to bite and people lose the freebies, spending drops further than it already has.  We start to see a wave of business closures .. not ""shut downs"", but going out of business, and this summer is when all the paper starts to burn.  What does that mean .. it means that one kind of bond defaults, and that leads to another, and leads to a bank default, which leads to a company going under, and so-on, as paper burns into autumn with defaults rising, the USD going up in price, the price of everything denominated in USD falls, and a very serious credit crunch develops over the next year or two.  The Fed continues to print money like its going out of style, .. but money isn't economic activity, and this time (unlike 2008/2009) there are limits, America is maxing out her credit cards.  Isolated bank runs.  Property markets in disarray.

During this time I think we see a wave of state and city bankruptcies, no way does the federal government backstop pension funds in states like California and New Jersey, they're going to let those states crash and burn in their own flames.  Municipal bond defaults, people who have had state and local government jobs who have assumed all this time they would be safe lose benefits and retirements, and at some point all of this is going to become critical and enter a very dark place as everything goes into full meltdown.  All of this may take a while, things always take longer to play out than you think they might, .. but at some point we get to a bottom with the government running the debt-to-GDP ratio to extraordinary levels in every western country, scrambling to stop the bleeding, with people becoming extremely desperate for work as waves of business closures happen and the public loses faith in everything but cash.  Widespread bank runs as people lose faith in the governments ability to protect depositors, pessimism is the new survival strategy, optimism an object of ridicule.

I think we get that in phase 1 (deflation) and into phase 2 (depression), let's call that the ""things aren't that bad yet"" phases.

Then I think things are going to go from bad to worse, as the ironic saying goes ""Things are always darkest before they go completely black"", and ""black"" in this case for the economy will be when governments in countries around the world continue to default on their obligations by buying their own bonds with their own currency, debasing the currency itself (which they've gotten away with because of deflation to this point), and the deflation ends as the fire in paper burns itself out.  That's when all is revealed, the emperor has no clothes, Keynesian economics fails, and governments find themselves in a position of not being able to continue to sustain themselves with printed money and debt anymore as interest rates start to rise uncontrollably and people lose faith in the currency itself.  Unlike previous currency collapses which have been local and isolated to individual countries (and southeast Asia two decades go), this time its a worldwide currency default, with currencies around the world falling like dominoes under the weight of unsustainable debt and low economic activity.  The world becomes Venezuela as people lose faith in their own governments' ability to exercise basic control, and the prices of simple commodities like food start to skyrocket out of control.  Money is not the same thing as economic activity, one isn't a substitute for the other, and countries around the world are faced with the choice of draconian cutbacks in the welfare state and essential government services, or complete default and loss of all faith in their ability to govern.  Tensions increase, employees of national governments (the last bastion of the upper middle class) start to lose everything during cutbacks .. urban people revolt and start blaming ""them"" for all the troubles, as the economy that once supported urban excess fails.  No doubt there is a return to the basics and people abandon their high minded ideas and extravagant cultural norms for food, shelter, and safety.  Isolated riots breaking out, entering into a period of extreme political views, street fighting and criminal activity against the weak, and an increase in people dying alone in the chaos.  Governments trying to restart currencies with varying degrees of success, but ultimately for a time the people lose faith in the financial markets and everyone essentially becomes a prepper.  Every person for themselves.

That's sort of phase 3 (devaluation or default), maybe call that ""things are getting kind of bad ..."" phase.

Then I think we get the rise of more extreme governments at all levels, political firebrands, outrageous rhetoric and attempts to bring the situation back under control with rising authoritarianism as people trade freedom for security, real militaristic kinds of lock downs, in some of the worst places there will be tanks in the streets, outraged people demanding basic justice and security, etc.  We see armed gangs in some of the more predictable areas, strong local leaders taking back control from centralized authorities, regionalism, larger political units breaking down with a rise in separatist movements taking over geographic areas, de-urbanization, stagnation of technological advancement (even losing the ability to create some things), and more radicalism.  Marginalized people become targets and scapegoats, purges of historical data from social media as old posts and viewpoints from the prior period of ""decadence"" causes people to become fearful.  Lots of food riots, famine, a return of diseases that prey on the weak and hungry .. feeding extremism, and anger ... the culture becomes focused on individual responsibility, survival and strength, individuals looking after their own, and general desperation.  All of this is by region, and some areas of the world are doing relatively well during all of this, but the world as a whole is troubled, not some kind of ""Mad max"" world or anything like that, but a lot more local crime and craziness.

That's sort of phase 4 (famine ..), and then ...

Beyond that you might imagine that local and regional conflicts expand and we end up in even worse shape after that ... these kinds of environments are the breeding grounds for extremism and war.  Maybe call that the ""Now you have something to cry about ..."" phase.

Or maybe summer cures people of the virus, we don't get hit with it again in autumn, the stock market breaks through 25000 and starts putting in new highs, economic activity increases as the world is hit with a new wave of young optimistic entrepreneurs, we enter into a new economic age, and someone splices genes together so that there are unicorns.

1229,A small UV-C decontamination chamber,"**Safety notice: You are doing it at your own risk. This is a mains-powered device which can cause electrocution. A fluorescent UV-C lamp contains toxic mercury (Hg) which will be released if it is broken. The device emits UV-C limit which can cause eyes and skin cancer. Do not use for decontamination of people and animals. **

**Ingredients**

- 1x Shoebox, 30 x 20 cm
- Aluminium foil
- Double-sided adhesive tape
- 1x UV-C lamp (here Osram Puritec HNS T5 G8 8W, Phillips TUV will work as well)
- 1x electronic ballast matching the lamp (here Tridonic PC Basic SL 4W-13W T5)
- 2x G8 socket with cable
- 1x Cable with AC plug and switch
- Cable ties

**Assembly**

The design is pretty straightforward. The inside of the shoe box and cover is covered in aluminium foil attached with double-sided adhesive tape. A T5 fluorescent lamp is placed diagonally on the inside of the cover and secured with cable ties running through the holes punched through the cover. A small opening is made in the side wall to allow running the cables out of the box. The cables are connected to the electronic ballast, which in turn is connected to mains socket via a switch. 

Image: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/mRosRph)

**Theory of operation: **

SARS-like CoVs are deactivated with UV-C light when effective does exceeds 1J/cm^2. Surface of the irradiation area will be roughly equal to the foot print of the box, i.e. 600cm^2. As 1 Joule is 1 Watt times 1 second, using 8W source we have 8W*75s=600J, i.e. the required dose will be delivered in 75 seconds of operation. Longer exposure time can be used at your discretion. 

The method can be used for decontamination of N95/FFP2 masks 10-20 times without loss of fit and filter. Doses above 100J/cm^2 have been found to degrade straps.  (However, for 10 decontamination cycles reaching that dose requires using 5x the minimum decontamination time). See [N95DECON website](https://www.n95decon.org/uvc) for details. 

**Usage**

Remove the top cover. Using gloves, place the object to be decontaminated inside the box. Wash the gloves with 70% alcohol for 1 minute. Place the top cover. Switch on the device. Verify emission of blue light from the holes. Wait at least 75 seconds. Remove top cover. Rotate the object upside down (bottom, unexposed side up). Wash the gloves with 70% alcohol for 1 minute. Place the top cover. Switch on the device. Verify emission of blue light from the holes. Wait at least 75 seconds. Remove top cover. Remove the decontaminated object.

1230,Meat shortage will cause other kinds of shortages,"Everybody here has probably heard that some large slaughterhouses have been shut down because many of the workers are sick with COVID-19. This is beginning to result in a meat shortage.

The thing about the meat shortage is that it will cascade into shortages of other kinds of foods. That's because people who like to eat meat will switch to poultry or fish if they can""t get meat. So then the demand for poultry and fish will rise; consequently, there will be shortages of poultry and fish. Prices for poultry and fish will rise, too, of course.

And so on. At some point, people desperate for protein will stoop to considering beans.

1232,Prep for nuclear war in autumn,"Expect a nuclear exchange this autumn after harvest. In addition to standard nuke prep, stock up on N95/N100 masks and filters, they will capture radioactive particles. (They were actually invented for people working with nuclear waste.) 

Rationale:

- The epidemic will weaken the US both economically and militarily (troops, particularly navy, getting infected). China has largely contained it, so they have an advantage. They may be tempted to use this to move ahead with the land grab they have been planning for a long time. 

- Alternatively, US may have an idea to respond militarily to China ""accidentally"" releasing a ""bioweapon"", particularly with election in November. 

- Governments have found that population can be forced to stay indoors, thus providing fallout protection without extra infrastructure. 

- Nuclear war should be fought in autumn after harvest, so that short-lived (most radioactive) isotopes decay before next year's harvest. 

Warning signs:

- official acknowledgement that it is an engineered virus

- official accusation that it came from a bioweapon program

- official accusation that China's response was intended to spread the virus while containing it at home

- China officially accusing US of releasing it in Wuhan to frame them

After this point, things will likely follow Kahn's escalation ladder: https://i.imgur.com/SeSlH7i.png

I'm looking for information-dense, more textbook style, than someone's memoir. Even better if it's super specific on a topic. A general homesteading book is nice, but separate books about gardening, canning, meal planning, raising chickens or rabbits, and sewing are going to bring a greater wealth of information. Also, some parts will simply not apply to all people.

Let's try to keep it to books that are still in print/easy to obtain used or do not have out of date information. A book made in the 60's may not be easily obtainable or has practices that we've since learned have better alternatives.

1238,Tip: move towards more plant focused meals to preserve your supplies and save money.,"Obviously there’s a lot of concern around food shortages especially with pork which will likely spillover to meat and poultry. 

Some context: I usually live by myself in a city and spend 35/wk on groceries. My diet is not vegetarian but plant focused. So I’ll use meat to flavor or “top” my meals off with.

I’m now with my family who are very meat focused. We are a family of five so go through at least 10-15 pounds of meat a week. 

This isn’t sustainable-I feel like we are constantly needing to get more meat. 

Some plant focused meal ideas:

Pastas beyond red sauce-mushroom sauce, pesto, pasta topped with some spicy sausage and olive oil. 

Curries-either Thai or Indian. Make sure you have a good amount of coconut milk and throw in some spices with beans veggies and rice. 

Stir frys with tofu vegetables and soba noodles. 

Frittatas 

Mediterranean spreads: make your own hummus and falafel with chickpeas. Top with yogurt sauce and herbs. 

Make sure you have a lot of good condiments.

It is a leased car, with the lease expiring this July, and so it's my responsibility to get it serviced and maintained when needed. I'm already worrying also about having to go to the car dealer this Summer for trading it in, but I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.

My dealer has a car pick-up and drop off service, which I'm planning to use to get the oil change. Anything I can do make the process safe? Fortunately, I just made a grocery run, so won't need to use my car for at least another week or so.

I can leave the keys on the seat when they come to pick it up, and ask them to do the same when they drop-off. I am planning to pay using my card over the phone. I guess this is as contact-less as it can get. Hope they don't need me to sign any papers when they pick up or drop off.

1240,Where is the line between stocking up and hoarding?,"When the virus was making itself known, the panic buying started. I remember before lockdown trying to buy just enough food for one week. That’s it. Only one week. Only for myself.

I failed. I went to the shop and everything was empty. No fruit. No veg. Diary products were gone and good luck finding frozen food. I had to resign to buying a few items for the next few days and coming back again that week.

The feeling it left me with was that people were being selfish. They were only thinking about themselves. (Now, if you are or live with someone who is high risk, fair enough. But that is not the case for most people)

I also imagined myself in the shoes of someone who was high risk, maybe someone elderly. I imagined them trying to buy maybe at least a week or two worth’s of food so that they could reduce how often they have to go out, reduce how often they have to put themself into that vulnerable position where they could catch the virus. But they can’t because other people took all the food. 

Honestly it really upset me. To see this side of people. To see that at the end of the day people only cared about themselves. Especially since if they just shopped like normal, buying a week or two worth of food, there would be enough food to go round.

1241,Talk me out of renting a powered storage unit and buying a chest freezer and a bunch of meat,"So I've been preparing for this since mid February.  Got about 700,000 calories in-house for a family of four.  Didn't need to panic-buy when the first wave hit.  My county has less than 25 confirmed cases, so I've been restocking with grocery pick-up as we've used stocks.

Amazingly, my wife is still questioning how much I'm buying.  If anything, I'm even more convinced it's necessary and things will get much much worse.  Had a small fight over this past weekend over whether we had too many olives &amp; cranberry juice stored.

In February I already bought one 7 cu. ft. chest freezer, and filled it.  Now hearing about the probable meat supply chain issues I'm thinking I'd like to get another.  We don't have a lot of extra room, so if I got another in the house it would likely be where I park my car in the garage.  Neighbors could see it, and notice the change.  Not ideal.  Also, I'm sure my wife would have a problem with it.

So, I did find a storage unit with power available.  I'm planning on renting a pickup tomorrow, renting that storage unit, and buying another chest freezer and filling it with meat in the storage unit.

Another problem is that I'd be giving in to the panic buying, what we say we're against and I was able to avoid so far.

1243,"XSuit, a suit company, is selling facemasks for this pandemic but there's a lot of suspicion surrounding the company. I did my own research, here's what I found. Is it a scam? What do you think?","There have been many complaints made against the US company XSuit in the past week surrounding the shipment of orders of their ""new"" facemasks. Customers are claiming that the company has gone silent on them and means of communications, such as Facebook, are being shut down. Shipping is taking longer than advertised or not even shipped out at all. I'm not law enforcement, a lawyer, or professional investigator but after looking into the company as a curious buyer, here's what I found:

XSuit, a company known for making suits is now selling masks online. Their masks come in two different models called the XMask and the XMask Pro. When I first visited the site, I was interested but then became incredibly suspicious when their XMask page contained marketing materials taken directly from the Swedish mask company, Airinum. The description of their filters is word for word an exact copy of the filter description by Airinum. Even the photo they use to show the filter layers is taken from Airinum. When I Google ""XSuit Airinum"", results show a short description under a link to the XMask Pro page that includes the Airinum support email. When the link is clicked, the webpage you are taken to contains nothing about Airinum. Strange. A reverse google image search of the XMask reveals that its actually sold by many different Chinese companies. The photos of the different models of XMask on the XSuit website also do not match the marketing they have below. The site boasts a photo of the two valves in the mask that feature these small ""claws"" that redirect the air to the side. However, the photos of the XMask without models wearing them are different valves. All versions of the mask, claw valve or not, can be found online and are sold through a handful of Chinese manufacturers. All the reviews on the XMask page were all posted within three days and are suspiciously all overly-positive, short, and vague. 

To make matters even more suspicious, the XMask Pro (sells for a ridiculous price of $119), can be found being sold on [Walmart.Ca](https://Walmart.Ca) and from the Chinese manufacturer themselves, MeHow. MeHow sells it for 369.00 Chinese Yuan which is about 52 USD and some change. On top of the price gouging on these masks, the XMask Pro page has an option to add replacement filters for the mask to your cart. However, XSuit only stocks the filter replacements for the regular XMask that has two valves and not the XMask Pro single valve filter meaning that they filter replacements they're advertising alongside the XMask Pro are not even compatible AT ALL.

The conclusion? It seems to me as though XSuit is dropshipping Chinese masks to US customers while using stolen marketing material from Swedish mask maker, Airinum, price gouging a high demand item, and falsely advertising replacement units that are not even compatible with their products. The delay in shipping for so many of their customers must be a result of the dropshipping from China. I can't say for sure this is the case, but I'd like to share my suspicions and evidence with everyone here so you can make an educated buying decision when purchasing masks to protect you and your loved ones. I think it's a scam, what do you think?  

I spoke to an Airinum customer support agent about XSuit and they told me that they are not partnered with the company. After hearing it from me, Airinum is now apparently investigating the stolen marketing material. I also posted this in r/scams and had a few customers comment that they too have experienced some shady activity from XSuit. Apparently they delete negative comments left by customers and utilize auto reply for support UNLESS you chargeback on the card you used. Once XSuit can't get money from your bank due to the chargeback, they attack you with a sudden rush of shipping info and claim that it will arrive soon. I sent XSuit a long message accusing them of stealing marketing materials and more. To my surprise, I got a hand-typed response. I can confirm, from what the rep said in the email, that they are shipping from ""their fulfillment centers in Asia"". In other words, they're certainly just dropshipping these masks from Chinese manufacturers. Their claim of 7-10 day delivery practically cannot be fulfilled with droppshipped orders from China. Buy from XSuit at your own risk!! Stay safe!

1244,Gluten free prepping,"Up front, I am not new to prepping but I am new to prepping with a family. I was a paranoid level prepper when I was a bachelor and then got pretty comfortable with the world as I met a girl, married, and we had children. My skills lie in defense and stocking goods and my wife's skills lie in growing food and being part of a community. We did live in a tent for a spell which was a wild time and a unique experience.

My wife and oldest child have to avoid gluten. They can eat it but they will have terrible digestive problems, rashes, irritability, sleep problems, etc. My youngest child and myself can eat whatever the hell we want without repercussions. My main goal is to be able to shelter in place for a month. Any more than that and I believe society is well fucked and we will need a solution that isn't in our storage area. Given we have adequate water supply and means to cook our food even if power and water are out, what do you suggest?

 I was honestly thinking of just plopping down a lump sum on some of those pre-prepared gluten free emergency meal kits for the 2 of them. I'd like to stock up on Banza noodles but the closest source is 45 minutes away and very busy every day and I don't love that idea.

At the moment I understand and can emphasise with everyone during this pandemic and I know times are tough. 

I live on cul de sac street with plenty of parents and elderly people. Everyone with little children are outside playing, which of course, means there is an issue of noise.

I'm a student in the last year of college with two weeks of online exams. The only place in my home to study is my room which faces the street. The noise, even with all windows closed is incredibly disruptive. 

I usually have an insane amount of patience when it comes to children, however, many parks are still open that they can go to, they have backgardens and they seem to meet with several different parents and children around the block on a daily basis for an average of five hours.

1249,Now for the financial pain ... (opinion),"Just my opinion, but I think its time for some of that financial pain to really start, for the recession to start biting, and for all the business closures and social distancing to really start causing some problems not just for people but for the finance markets.

I said in another post I thought we'd get a kind of breakout that had the DJIA reach up to touch 25k before we went back down to test the lows, and that is basically happening today ... so my bet (literally) is that this rally is done.

First of the month is here again, except this time there isn't stimulus checks to pay rent, .. and now the people who own all the property that people aren't paying their rent on are really going to start suffering, .. how many won't be able to pay the mortgages on the property that is for all practical purposes no longer producing any kind of income, and in many (most) cases costing a lot of money, some landlords include utilities in rent, for example, and those bills still have to be paid.

It's been fun and games up until now, but I think we're to the point now where all of this really starts to hit home for people, where people start getting a little stir crazy, where they start to see the long game, the markets brush off this rally, and when the mindset changes and everyone starts to see clearly that this is something that is going to drag on for a long time.

But situation is about to change: I am being forced to go back to work at a school. I will see about 400 kids and adults every single day and I cannot avoid this. I cant stay at home and be ”sick” or anything else. 

I dont think we are getting any masks, handsanitizer or anything else. Just soap and water and we are told to ”Wash your hands.” 

This makes me so angry that I cannot even talk about this much. But I am still going to work, that I have decided. I dont think there are any ideas that would make me going back to work feel any safer, so I am getting prepared to get sick now.

Thankfully my usual dentist is open for emergency appointments and I think I would be able to book one. 

Problem is, I live in a small apartment with a high risk family member. I'm not really sure what to do. I think if I catch the virus at the dentist and get sick myself, it would suck but I would make it. Thought about quarantining myself in a hotel or or any other place for two weeks afterwards but it's just not financially possible. We don't have a garage either. Even thought of converting my car into a space to stay in. Most realistic option is to quarantine myself in my room in the apartment after the dental visit for two weeks. We each have our own bathrooms so I would keep my door and bathroom closed and mask myself when I would need to go out to access the bathroom. Won't go into kitchen or living area. Maybe have food/water left at my door in disposable plates/etc. Before the appointment, I would make sure to have stock of perishable food or anything we would need over the next month.

1260,So what are professional masks made of?,"- There are two problems in making a mask: one is filtering, the other is leakage. 

- Let's start with leakage. Any solution which makes the mask fit against the face is good. Rubber bands will work, so will women's nylon thighs. 

- Filtering media is typically non-vowen polipropylene (PP). It exists in two main types, meltblown and spunbound (depending on the production process). 

- Medical masks are made of a three-layer composite: spunbound-meltblown-spunbound (SMS), welded ultrasonically. 

- See if you can source SMS composite in bulk, if yes, you can make masks quickly and cheaply. 

- If not, then see if you can source meltblown polypropylene which is used as filter layer. Again, see if you can get it in bulk, or look for items made from this. 

- Medical masks are intended to stop 99% of particles sized 2.7um or above. Since the virus travels on water droplets, this should be enough practically speaking. Medical masks use middle layer of 25 g/m2 meltblown PP. This seems to be the most common fabric also. 

- Filtering efficiency of 100g/m2 meltblown PP against virus-sized (0.125um) particles is 95%. As the common fabric is 25 g/m2, so either use four layers or rely on the fact that virus travels on water droplets, and a single layer is enough (see above). 

- Filtering efficiency can be increased to 99% by polarizing the fabric with 30kV voltage, which will cause electrostatic charge to be trapped in the fabric. DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME, YOU WILL KILL YOURSELF. 

- However, a professional engineer should be able to construct a device which can polarize fabric for small scale manufacturing. 

- A professional should be also able to replicate the equipment needed to test filtration efficiency.

1272,How to deal with messy and disorganized canned storage,"It's a stupid question, but I need to ask because seeing the mess every day bothers me. 

I live in a very small apartment with only 2 closets (that are already filled with household goods and my clothes).  I have an existing 4 tier shelf that has some canned goods on it, plus starches and oils and other stuff. The larger shelf is organized by baskets and category. It's decently neat. 

In February when I started prepping, I bought a small three tier chrome shelving to store additional canned food and other food preps. It measures about 13 x 24 x 31 inches and it's crammed full. The cans are standing vertically, 2 or 3 stacked on top of one another, and about 3 or 4 cans deep depending on how big the can is. The problem is nothing is organized so that things are readily accessible. If I want corn, I have to pull out the peas to get to the corn. Then I have to stack all the cans back. The top shelf is crammed with all of my cereals and flours and baking products so the cans have to fit on just two shelves. 

Does anybody have any suggestions on how to better organize this? 

\-If i got baskets (could they accommodate all the canned goods I have because I think the baskets would cut into the space and actually not hold as much?)

1273,Canned meat vs frozen,"I've been buying some canned chicken from my local BJ's wholesale club and local large grocery store.  I've gotten 3 brands.  Some are good until 2022 while others 2023.  And the only ingredients are chicken salt and water.   I tell some friends and family about it and they are grossed out.  I popped a few cans and threw it in with some pasta sauce for spaghetti, and then tried it with ramen, and then cut it up and squished it with a fork and mixed it with mayonnaise.  I have absolutely no complaints and this tastes and feels perfectly fine.  

I could keep buying these.  On the other hand I could try to get my hands on a freezer.  But how long can meat stay good in a freezer.

1275,Every prep skill you learn is a SHTF/TEOTWAWKI business ...,"Think about it, every single skill you learn as a prepper is a business if the SHTF/TEOTWAWKI comes along, because the very skills you learn for SHTF are the ones that will be needed the most, that's why you're learning them.  You're also buying the equipment needed to use those skills, and again, that'll be what makes it all so valuable if SHTF.

* Canning - your simple skills of doing water bath and pressure canning, along with the equipment, would be invaluable to other people as a service.
* Dehydrating - your skills at dehydrating food, again, invaluable to anyone who needs to preserve food from the harvest, from their gardens, from animals, etc.
* Radio - if you're someone who does radio prep, if that was ever needed you could probably trade for communicating messages long distances, helping people talk to their loved ones, etc, like an old time telegraph operator.
* Cutting wood - a valuable trade even today, in rural areas people advertise firewood for sale all the time.
* Hunting - again, invaluable, being able to trade meat that you have harvested
* Gardening - invaluable, you could expand with your knowledge and harvesting seeds and start making excess food to trade
* Water purification - drinking water is again invaluable, and if you've learned how to purify it you will again have something to trade
* Cooking - again, people would be hungry, being able to take raw food and make cooked food that is delicious, uses ingredients you can get, etc, it's something to trade

I could go on and on .. but the point is, people sometimes post asking what SHTF items they could trade with other people for things they want if it all goes to hell, but it's the very equipment and skills that you are learning \_right\_now\_ during this pandemic and during your efforts to learn to prep that ARE the thing you could trade if it ever came to it.

1276,Moving locations. What to pack in a giant suitcase to stock myself for a few weeks?,"Hi all. 

I’m currently bugged out at parents house outside of the city. Going back to nyc for personal reasons-SO has been stuck there and is injured+death in their family. I want to stock enough food for a few weeks for myself (he’s stocked food for himself). I had left some food there as my backup prep but honestly forgot.



Considerations are that I’ll have a car getting there but am using an elevator so only want to take one trip. Help me prioritize my preps-note I will be getting a weekly produce box delivered every week. 

-cleaning supplies (latex gloves,Chlorox, n95 masks)
-5lbs frozen sausage 
-a few steaks
-5lbs chicken
-dried chickpeas
-a few frozen meals/stews
-rice/farro
-some boxes of pasta and rice noodles 
-3 packages tofu 
-coconut milk (for healthy fat) 
-premixed spice blends
-3 dozen eggs
-coffee
-3 loaves bread
-multivitamin


Does this seem reasonable? My goal is to minimize overall elevator trips. I will be walking to SO house so am planning on that being my only weekly trip out. My building has a rooftop deck so will get vitamin D there.",PandemicPreps,1588600615,academicgirl,10,1,True,2020-05-04 06:56:55,hi currently bugged parents house outside city going back nyc personal reasons stuck injured death family want stock enough food weeks stocked food left food backup prep honestly forgot car getting using elevator want take one trip help prioritize preps note getting weekly produce box delivered every week supplies latex gloves chlorox n masks lbs frozen sausage steaks lbs chicken dried chickpeas frozen meals stews rice farro boxes pasta rice noodles packages tofu coconut milk healthy fat premixed spice blends dozen eggs coffee loaves bread multivitamin seem reasonable goal minimize overall elevator trips walking house planning weekly trip building rooftop deck get vitamin,hi current bug parent hous outsid citi go back nyc person reason stuck injur death famili want stock enough food week stock food left food backup prep honestli forgot car get use elev want take one trip help priorit prep note get weekli produc box deliv everi week suppli latex glove chlorox n mask lb frozen sausag steak lb chicken dri chickpea frozen meal stew rice farro box pasta rice noodl packag tofu coconut milk healthi fat premix spice blend dozen egg coffe loav bread multivitamin seem reason goal minim overal elev trip walk hous plan weekli trip build rooftop deck get vitamin
1277,Question about Shipt,"Shipt has been a great resource, primarily for dairy and produce, at our grocery store. I've used them three times in the past two months.  This past Saturday it took almost 20 minutes for our shopper to meet us in the parking lot after the total was charged to the credit card. 

The woman apologized profusely, explaining that she was completing three orders at that time. How do the shoppers even keep the orders straight? Especially if substitutions are involved? I request the most basic of products and usually order two of everything. 

Shipt shoppers - is it often that you're fulfilling two or more orders at a time? What can I do, beyond responding immediately to your texts about possible substitutions, to make your work easier? 

And as for tipping, I'm torn. Yes, there's the option to add it to the order. No doubt that's safer. But I've been handing an envelope with cash directly to the shopper. Perhaps I should go the safer route.

1280,Rate my preps,"Guys I need your help and opinion on my preps. I live in a small European country where COVID-19 has yet to hit hard (1700 cases right now), but the lockdown just got lifted and I am expecting things to get very bad in a couple of weeks. PPE is very hard to find, but I am constantly trying to get more. 

I am prepping on a tight budget for a family of 4 and the items listed are meant to be kept as a reserve and not be used unless things go bad and we have to bug in and only go for emergency shop runs or hospital visits. We do have our regular PPE that we use on daily basis.

I'm trying to think of something I might've missed or I don't have enough of. Again, on a tight budget and N95/FFP2/Surgical masks/Alcohol/Hand sanitizer are near impossible to get right now.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

# 🌟 Preparing For Coming Waves of the Pandemic 🌟

It is deadly to assume that just because the first wave is mainly targeting vulnerable people that it doesn't have the potential to mutate and become deadly to people who are not considered vulnerable. Be vigilant. Do not plan to rejoin the masses as lockdowns ease. The 1918 pandemic came in 3 deadly waves. [(learn more here) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCF_ePFYPDU)

Keep in mind that SARS still doesn't have a vaccine nearly 20 years later. For those who's counter argument is that there wasn't enough money for that consider that HIV still has no known cure or vaccine and it's 40 years later. We are likely to have to deal with this for much longer than the 2 year mark the governments are trying to sell. Keep prepping.

**Good things to do now to help for the next waves**

&amp;#x200B;

* Keep your finances as healthy as possible. Add to or start a emergency fund. Consider looking for alternative sources of money to create multiple revenue streams.

&amp;#x200B;

* Continue or start to work on your physical health. Exercise daily, eat healthy foods.

&amp;#x200B;

* Top off supplies of all types. Particularly those that were in short supply in your area.

&amp;#x200B;

* Check your security and weapons. Practice with any weapons you plan to use. If they have to lockdown again it's likely that people will become increasingly financially insecure. Crime usually follows.

&amp;#x200B;

* Brush up on basic and trauma first aid. Brush up on your CPR training.

&amp;#x200B;

* Complete vehicle repairs. Check the basics and consider doing some preventative maintenance.

&amp;#x200B;

* Learn skills that would be essential in a collapse situation (electronic repair, baking, growing food, making herbal medicines, carpentry, hunting, brewing alcohol) all make excellent hobbies as well.

&amp;#x200B;

* Plant a garden that will be ready to harvest in the fall / winter 

&amp;#x200B;

* Finalize and practice any bug out or contingency plans you have in place.

&amp;#x200B;

* Learn or brush up on the languages common in your area that aren't your native language.

&amp;#x200B;

* Don't forget about your mental health. Work on any issues you may have as they usually bubble up to the surface when things get really bad and can be a liability for you.

&amp;#x200B;

* Write a will, power of attorney. Get life insurance. Don't assume just because you prepped it won't come to this. It might. Please do not leave your family without a plan if the worst happens.

&amp;#x200B;

With no shortage of possible natural disasters like hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes, fires and others a pandemic brings additional challenges to normal preparation routines. We've had a lot of people who are asking what to do now to prepare for the coming waves. We have some great posts and I will be referring people to this page so we aren't inundated with the same questions. This isn't an exhaustive list but if you're able to do all of this you will be better off than 98% of people.

I heard someone walking up towards my house and then heard severe coughing and frantic banging on my door. The person on the other side wheezed ""ma'am"" and mumbles off some other words as they jiggle the door handle. 

My first thought was that maybe a neighbor was dying on my doorstep (the coughing was that violent). 2nd thought was that it was a trap to get me to open the door. I run to the back door to make sure it's locked and then ran upstairs to get closer to my boyfriend's Mossberg that he keeps at my house and to look out the window. A group of 6 people tweaking out on drugs were just mindlessly roaming my neighborhood. I live in a city but this neighborhood isn't in the metro area at all and it's mainly older folks so it was highly unusual.

1296,New to Reddit. Have some prepping experience (snowstorms). Feeling overwhelmed about where to start &amp; what to do.," I've only ever prepped in Fall for the upcoming Winter.. I survived 2 snowstorms with power outages which is why I started prepping for winter years ago. Another reason is that I get severe depression during the winter, so I prepare for those days when I can't cook or clean or do anything. Now the pandemic is a whole other level...I'm smart &amp; have common sense, but I have only very basic survival skills.

So my concerns are:  
1. What basic survival skills do I need to know first? Which are most important?  
2. What are the most important basic survival needs/prep items? What should I buy (on a limited budget)?  
3. Anything else you want to add.

I'm reading everything, on Reddit, the News, Survival Websites, etc. Like I said, I'm feeling overwhelmed by all the lists of what to do &amp; what to buy &amp; what skills to learn.

I should add that I'm 52, female, single, and poor at the moment. I was in the process of filing for disability, but the pandemic is holding that up. So, I'm really dealing with this alone and no support system. On the plus side, I'm smart &amp; have common sense. And, I can deal with being alone for long periods of time (even though it sucks).

I decided to set goals &amp; make a plan. I think it's a good  place to start, but could use some ""non-overwhelming"" advice for my plan too.

I realize I'm asking very general questions here. I could get more specific, but I didn't want to make this post too long.

To give back to the group, I'm going to be posting great ideas on survival food &amp; meals. I have organization tips as well.

Thanks!

1298,Selling/buying home during pandemic?,"My husband and I lost our jobs this week (same company, pandemic cuts). We live in a small town about 90 minutes from a major city where I'm supposed to be starting grad school in the fall. He has a part time weekend job near the city as well, and has been commuting, and I was planning to commute for grad school. However, without jobs keeping us here, we're considering moving closer to the city.


So here's the dilemma: we own a home here, and until he gets full time work there, I can't imagine we'd qualify for a new mortgage. Do we:


A. Don't sell our home and commute. (Pros: moving is expensive and time consuming, especially given that we have enough food for 4-6 months prepped; there a decent chance my classes will be online in the fall and I wouldn't have to commute anyway. Cons: long commute; possible covid exposure due to moving; living in an area with much higher covid prevalence; small town economy more likely to collapse and decrease home value if we stay?)


B. Sell our home and rent an apartment in the city. (Pros: it will give us a large chunk of cash on hand; shorter commute. Cons: more covid exposure; difficult to move preps into small apartment.)


C. Stay here until husband finds full time work and then buy house near city. (Pros: possibly the best of both A and B. Cons: we have some friends with a baby due in July who are ready to buy our house now if we want to sell, and waiting longer will be too late for them; home value is still good now but I don't know if it could fall, depending on what happens with the economy?)


What I can't figure out is how to weigh the various financial possibilities over the next couple years. Is having cash on hand a higher priority than home ownership? Which is more likely to give financial stability in a pandemic? Would the financial stability of living in a larger city (many of the businesses in our town are small businesses, and not as likely to survive the pandemic) outweigh the lower virus exposure of living in a small town?",PandemicPreps,1588881951,ceruleancats,74,2,True,2020-05-07 13:05:51,husband lost jobs week company pandemic cuts live small town minutes major city supposed starting grad school fall part time weekend job near city well commuting planning commute grad school however without jobs keeping us considering moving closer city dilemma home gets full time work imagine qualify new mortgage sell home commute pros moving expensive time consuming especially given enough food months prepped decent chance classes online fall commute anyway cons long commute possible covid exposure due moving living area much higher covid prevalence small town economy likely collapse decrease home value stay sell home rent apartment city pros give us large chunk cash hand shorter commute cons covid exposure difficult move preps small apartment stay husband finds full time work buy house near city pros possibly best b cons friends baby due july ready buy house want sell waiting longer late home value still good know could fall depending happens economy figure weigh various financial possibilities next couple years cash hand higher priority home ownership likely give financial stability pandemic would financial stability living larger city many businesses town small businesses likely survive pandemic outweigh lower virus exposure living small town,husband lost job week compani pandem cut live small town minut major citi suppos start grad school fall part time weekend job near citi well commut plan commut grad school howev without job keep us consid move closer citi dilemma home get full time work imagin qualifi new mortgag sell home commut pro move expens time consum especi given enough food month prep decent chanc class onlin fall commut anyway con long commut possibl covid exposur due move live area much higher covid preval small town economi like collaps decreas home valu stay sell home rent apart citi pro give us larg chunk cash hand shorter commut con covid exposur difficult move prep small apart stay husband find full time work buy hous near citi pro possibl best b con friend babi due juli readi buy hous want sell wait longer late home valu still good know could fall depend happen economi figur weigh variou financi possibl next coupl year cash hand higher prioriti home ownership like give financi stabil pandem would financi stabil live larger citi mani busi town small busi like surviv pandem outweigh lower viru exposur live small town

Seems like the food item is touching a wall of the freezer it’s freezing solid but things in the center are not. And this is days and days of the item being in there. The wattage is correct and the temp is turned to almost the very lowest setting. Is it because it packed basically 95% full? The only thing we are doing that’s not recommended is using a short extension cord to plug it in. Not sure how to work around this since all the outlets in the garage are up too high for the regular chest freezer cord to reach.

1313,Home repair- need advice,"Hey everyone. I have some questions about how to deal with a home repair issue during this time of COVID. 

I’m very high risk (asthma and high blood pressure) and I’ve been sheltering in place and having everything delivered since March 13th. Well, it warmed up a week ago, and last Sunday I tried to turn on my air conditioner. It ran for 17.5 hours and wouldn’t really cool my apartment down, so I had to put in a dreaded maintenance request.

My maintenance people are lazy so they waited until Friday to even come and look at the outside unit (which I was hoping would be the cause) and the guy said he didn’t see anything wrong with the outside unit and that he would need to come in to my apartment to check the internal parts (condensing unit) located in the ceiling above my shower. 

I live in a small one bedroom apartment that doesn’t have a lot of external air flow or an in house ceiling fan so I’m very concerned. To make matters worse, we are having a cold front and rain this coming week, and he said he won’t come until Monday, May 18th which is the next day it’s supposed to be over 70 and without rain. The cases in my area are climbing rapidly by the day so his chance for exposure and in turn my chance for exposure is only going to increase. However, it gets to over 100 degrees here, so I’m not sure I can go all summer without this repair.

My questions are: would you let this person in to do a home repair under these circumstances? What can I do to stop or mitigate my risk? I’ve been having major anxiety up to and including panic attacks about this issue as I lay in wait for him to come.

1320,♻ BREATHE V2 ♻ N95 Exhalation Valve with BRASS Filter,"Hi folks,

The main weakness in exhalation valves is the lack of filtering during exhalation.  I addressed this by adding a BRASS mesh filter to my original re-usable BREATHE exhalation valve design.  The mesh filter will catch and significantly reduce moisture droplets expelling from the exhaust ports.  In addition to that, the filter is made of brass (a copper alloy) which has natural anti-microbial properties and will inactivate viruses/bacteria within hours of surface contact.

I have a video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY-JRdLtIrE&amp;feature=youtu.be

I open sourced the design here for anyone that uses 3D printers (though, you'll have to source your TPE rubber gasket and mesh filters yourself as I purchase them in bulk from American manufacturers).  For folks that don't have access to 3D printing, I do produce them at $10 CAD (about $7.50 USD) on my website which I won't link here.

My mom agreed to it, and I understand why he should be home, and I am very glad he's home, but he's make it very clear that once he gets here he won't be taking precautions in her house to reduce the chance of her getting sick. 

He is willfully defiant in heeding my warnings that travelling like he is today could absolutely get him and our mom sick. I understand that he can't quarantine, but she will be at work most of the time so it is his responsibility to keep as clean as possible, wash hands and surfaces and cover his mouth when he coughs (which he never does). 

I told him I will never fucking forgive him if his lack of precaution gets our mom sick. So help me god if his careless attitude results in getting her sick someone will HAVE to keep me 6 feet away from him so I don't deck him in the face. 

Right now is not the time to be tiptoeing around the issue and because he will be here in a few hours I felt it was the last chance I had to make my point and tell how serious I am about it.

'People who wear gloves feel a false sense of security and are more likely to touch their face, etc.' - except I don't. Wearing gloves helps me be SUPER aware of what I'm touching and helps me be very cautious.

1329,Tip: How to deal with rice weavils,"I just learned this uesterday. So I bought a 25lb bag of sushi rice at costco several months ago. I separated it into gallon ziplock bags (double bagged... I do this with all of my dry goods) and it has been stored in my pantry. I generally go through a ziplock bag (about 4-5lbs)  every couple of months or so, and the bag I'm on now has weavils in it, as do my other ones, upon further inspection. Luckily they haven't spread to anything else, and by bagging them up in ziplock bags I've been able to isolate the source of the weavils, which was costco. So it pays to keep this stuff sealed in individual bags.

Anyway, my main point was getting rid of rice weavils. You don't actually have to throw the rice away. You can freeze the rice for a week to kill the eggs (this is apparently better done right after buying... Hindsight's 20/20). In order to deal with live weavils, boil a pot of water measure out the amount of rice you want to make, pour the rice in a bowl, and pour the boiling water on top. The weavils die quickly and float to the top. You can scoop them off with a ladle. Keep stirring, scooping, and rinsing the rice with fresh cold water until they're all gone (this is a much easier/quicker than it might sound. Just make sure the weavils can't spread (freezing should take care of this)... The rice itself will remail perfectly edible.",PandemicPreps,1589405780,NationalCupcake7,30,1,True,2020-05-13 14:36:20,learned uesterday bought lb bag sushi rice costco several months ago separated gallon ziplock bags double bagged dry goods stored pantry generally go ziplock bag lbs every couple months bag weavils ones upon inspection luckily spread anything else bagging ziplock bags able isolate source weavils costco pays keep stuff sealed individual bags main point getting rid rice weavils actually throw rice away freeze rice week kill eggs apparently better done right buying hindsight order deal live weavils boil pot water measure amount rice want make pour rice bowl pour boiling water top weavils die quickly float top scoop ladle keep stirring scooping rinsing rice fresh cold water gone much easier quicker might sound make sure weavils spread freezing take care rice remail perfectly edible,learn uesterday bought lb bag sushi rice costco sever month ago separ gallon ziplock bag doubl bag dri good store pantri gener go ziplock bag lb everi coupl month bag weavil one upon inspect luckili spread anyth els bag ziplock bag abl isol sourc weavil costco pay keep stuff seal individu bag main point get rid rice weavil actual throw rice away freez rice week kill egg appar better done right buy hindsight order deal live weavil boil pot water measur amount rice want make pour rice bowl pour boil water top weavil die quickli float top scoop ladl keep stir scoop rins rice fresh cold water gone much easier quicker might sound make sure weavil spread freez take care rice remail perfectli edibl

1331,Meat counter decimated,"Went to my local Food Lion today here in Middle TN. Meat was completely annihilated. Literary almost nothing left. The clerk stocking said their meat processing plant has closed and what’s left is it. No more deliveries until further notice. 

Last week the butcher I use in Southern KY about an hour away told me he didn’t have enough meat to last the week and had no idea when he was getting another shipment.  

Y’all I’ve never seen anything like this. Even with stores imposing strict limits, people broke with no income coming in and food prices rising we’ve gotten to a point we can’t access meat. I come from a family of cattle ranchers and it’s not an issue on the farmers end though they are paying the price for this. The meatpacking industry is still failing to provide workers with proper PPE, social distancing and lacking in sanitation after an outbreak. While I understand why the President enacted the Defense Production Act on meat processing they still need time to close and disinfect to make it a safe(r) environment for workers. It cannot stay open when all the workers are dropping like flies from the virus. 

Please I urge you if you haven’t prepped yet to start now. If you have family and friends that haven’t prepped guide them on how to start and get them started now. I fear things are going to get much worse in the coming months. I anticipate the second wave hitting by the middle of June beginning of July not fall.

1342,"Can we talk return to school, homeschooling and ‘blended at-home learning’?","So, mom of four, two upper HS and two elementary aged kids. All public schooled. 

HS kids are fine and gifted/strong students- not worried about them. They will be fine and off to college regardless of all lack teaching.

No one was prepared in our district for what we have faced. I understand and have been tolerant. But, I have been watching and...

Plopping them in-front of digital reading (Raz Kids) and math (scoot pad) portals is not instruction- regardless of how much it is ‘aligned’. Packets of work sheets are not developing them as writers. Chaotic assignment methods are frustrating and confusing all of us. 

Ugh. Frankly, now that I know what tools to use (see above); I can do that without dealing with my school system putting my kids are risk in the fall. Not to mention the teachers who don’t know  the diff between en email, pm or a comment thread. 

So - who is rethinking out-of-home schooling for their kids in the fall?

What are you considering as a replacement? A diy curriculum or a public-school digital?

Or, have you been able to open dialog and get traction speaking to your school district about improving at-home learning systems?

1345,Conjecture that Coronavirus infections may be permanent,"1. Virus load in saliva at peak infection is 1E6-1E8 (1M-100M) copies per ml measured by PCR. People are declared cured when the PCR finds no virus. However, PCR has a detection limit of 1E2 (100) copies per ml. [See this graph](https://i.redd.it/5m4z2fis2tu41.png)

2. In case of H1N1 influeza, 50% of population gets infected when inhaling 1E3 (1000) copies. Nobody knows how many copies of SARS-CoV-2 one needs to inhale to get infected, but let us assume it is similar. 

3. Consider a person with 1E1 (10) copies per ml in blood. The PCR will report negative. However they have 5 liters of blood, so they carry around 5E4 (50K copies) on them. This is enough to get them ""reinfected"" and go back to the acute stage.

4. In the acute stage, the virus load in saliva rises to 1E6-1E8 copies per ml (see above) and the person starts spreading. Further, there is no difference in virus load between asymptomatic and symptomatic people. The acute stage lasts about 48h, then the virus load drops to 1E3 copies per ml, then it needs about a week to go below the PCR detection limit of 1E2 copies per ml.  This means the infection can flare up, the person can spread for 48h, and go back to latent stage all without symptoms. 


5. If this is true, then the only effective way to control the spread is to round up everyone with antibodies and put them in camps.

1350,I have a question about the show “Doomsday Preppers.”,"I haven’t seen every single episode ever. 

But in all the episodes I’ve watched, they NEVER mention medical preps. 

First aid supplies, medication stashes like antibiotics, IV lines and supplies, masks, gloves, anti-septics, surgical supplies etc. having a doctor or nurse or health care professional as part of their prepping team... 

I have seen supplies for a biohazard or dirty bomb or gas scenario but not just basic medical supplies. 

They claim on the show they would be able to survive months or years, some are planning to survive in a bunker, what if someone ever gets hurt or gets sick, develops a condition or you know, the catalyst itself was a PANDEMIC... 

My thought is that is something that they don’t want to give away maybe what they have for this?

1372,Would you take a trip if your only expected exposure was a stairwell?,"Ok and an extra gas fill up, but let's be honest: we should all be capable of getting gas without being exposed to surface contamination. 

For background, we're super safe, work from home, only grocery pickup, no fraternizing with anyone level precautions people. 

We have the opportunity to go to the beach to my in law's condo. I don't know if I'd ever actually go, but I also feel like I need to strongly consider our family's mental health with our self imposed lockdown looking indefinite. We're travel people and our highly hyped spring trip was cancelled for obvious reasons. The in laws haven't been there for 3 weeks, probably 5-6 by the time we'd go (we'd definitely go after memorial day). The condo is on the beach so we'd just enjoy the breeze and watch the waves from the patio until beachgoers cleared at dusk and we'd let our son play in the sand and surf then. The beach is never crowded as the condo doesn't allow renters, so the people on the beach are only owners (or friends and family they lent it to). I expect zero risk from our actual beach time. 

We'd bring all our food and not go to any stores, just like we do here. 

To get to the condo though, we'd have to take the elevator or enclosed stairs. I'd choose stairs bc the elevator is cold while stairs are hot and humid and less traveled. Do you consider the stairwell a significant risk? I tell myself that a sick person isn't going to take the stairs, so wearing a mask is protection enough, but I also know that the stairwell would be more iffy than anything we're doing at home so it makes me nervous. 

Also, yes I could stay home and keep prepping, but a few days of break wouldn't hurt. I'm pretty tired of it all right now anyway. I could use a break. We went from lite prep to pretty comfy prep in two months that were a flurry of buying.

I don't really *want* to buy a pot or learn to can, but am feeling more and more like I should.","I started looking at pressure canners today. It's the one thing I've been avoiding. We bought a dehydrator, it's been chugging for like a month straight. Mylar bags, oxygen absorbers, silica gel, deep freezer packed, garden ramped up...we went all in on many things but I've always avoided canning for two reasons: fear of killing my family, and not wanting to deal with the commotion. 

We have a nice garden set up, but it's only good sized when you consider it's in a neighborhood backyard. We have new land that we'll ultimately plant on, thus increasing our surplus, but only in the Fall at the earliest. All that said, I'd rather buy canned fruits and veggies than can our own. However, I think we can all acknowledge that we may have to adapt to a new way of life in the near future. Instead of looking like we can see a light at the end, the tunnel instead seems to be getting longer and maybe darker. 

Canning is the last frontier I've avoided. Is it very important for preparing for a potential depression? Why is canning important if you have a dehydrator and a deep freezer? I'm assuming if you're getting canning supplies you may as well be prepared to pressure can?

1388,My method for grocery decontamination and reduction of risk when buying groceries or getting take out,"This question comes up a lot so o thought I would write a post about what I specifically do for my family. If you have an observation about something I may be doing wrong please correct me but at this point I think it’s a really solid approach. 

**buying groceries**

- prepare before leaving the house, go to the bathroom, get your hair out of your face etc 

- check to make sure I have the needed supplies (list, gloves, n95, sanitizer, cash) 

- head to the store wearing gloves and n95. I wear gloves for two reasons. The first reason being that it reminds me to be extra cautious and not touch my face. The second being that hands often get small cuts so I find it’s better to keep them covered in high risk environments. 

- purchase groceries. I don’t wipe down the cart. Most stores are disinfecting them actively 

- if buying takeout I order online and forgo all produce that doesn’t reheat well at home like lettuce on a burger for example. I replace with thoroughly washed veggies from home. 

**decontamination at home**

- I use a solution of 1/10 parts bleach to water and wipe down the outside of any packaging.

- I have a “clean” counter and a “dirty” counter. All items from the store go on the floor in bags, once they are ready to be decontaminated they go on the counter to be dealt with. 

- I hand wash produce thoroughly with soap for 20 seconds. For berries I rinse then soak in vinegar for 5-10 minutes. 

- after decontamination I decontaminate all the surfaces they new items have come in contact with or I touched. 

- with takeout I discard all packaging and reheat. Replace produce that’s needed for the dish. 

Hope this helps someone who might be confused or is just starting to do this. 

- I leave the items on the counter to dry.

1392,My UV-C Bulbs Efficacy Study,"After doing some research on UV-C disinfection technology to kill COVID-19 on facemasks for reuse and clothing. There is not yet studies on UV-C sanitizing COVID-19 specifically, but rather on similar virus:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_germicidal_irradiation
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4702654/
I decided to make a Decontamination Chamber for the home. The idea is to make a closet space enclosure, put some UV-C bulbs inside, and put a timer to turn the bulbs on for 30 minutes at a time, and door switches to turn off the bulb when door is opened, for safety.

Here is the work in progress: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0oZOOXOaHc (components used are listed in video info)

When I started the project, UV-C bulbs were already becoming rare on the market, and my first purchase took a month to arrive (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0867G6DMJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and turned out to be fake. It did not emit any UV-C light, which I suspected, and later verified (Bulb A below).

Some more research led to this product (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087NSTC1W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1), which seemed more promising because it incorporated the proper UV-C LED components.

Not willing to rely on merchant specification after being bitten by the fake bulb, I looked for ways to verify that the bulb actually emitted UV-C radiation. Having no access to a proper spectrophotometer, I went the DIY route and built a simple one out of a GUVA-S12SD 240nm-370nm UV Detection Sensor Module Light Sensor (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CLFK9RK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and built a simple ESP8266 Tasmota based meter. This meter simply gave a continuous read-out of the GUVA-S12SD sensor via a Wemos D1 mini Pro A2D converter as a percentage of maximum sensor output.

With this meter, I just finished a study where I measured all the UV-C bulbs in my possession at various distance.

My data and the charts are available at the Google Sheets
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mJLHm59wuAH0FIwLSwrZkkzDs_0rOWmbKi9zNU1pjgw/edit?usp=sharing

Bulbs tested:

Bulb A: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0867G6DMJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1
Bulb B: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RSY3H3J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1
Bulb C: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087NSTC1W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1
Bulb D: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08561486K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1
With the use of two optical filter I had in my possession:

280nm bandpass filter: Lets wavelengths around 280nm through only
UV block filter: Blocks all UV wavelengths. This filter came with Bulb C in for form of protective glasses.
I hoped to get enough information to tell which bulb is best for UV-C generation.

Conclusions:

Bulb A: Fake, practically no UV light blocked by UV block filter, hence not much UV generated.
Bulb B: Real Hg tube UV-C, no ozone 36W. Almost all blocked by UV block filter, decent reading through 280nm bandpass filter.
Bulb C: Real UV-LED, but not effective past 1 foot radius.
Bulb D: Real Hg tube UV-C, ozone 25W. Almost all blocked by UV block filter, decent reading through 280nm bandpass filter.
I will be selecting Bulb B for my Decontamination Chamber project, because of its higher UV-C casting distance, as well no no ozone to clear out after usage. Bulb C has the right components, but was unable to cast any meaningful UV-C radiation past 1 foot distance.

I'm hoping if anyone who knows about such apartment central AC infrastructure can tell me if any of the air gets shared or re-circulated or comes into contact with air from other units as it travels through the ducts?

My initial guess would be that none of the air gets shared, since we all pay our own AC bill and have our own thermostat, but can anyone confirm? I called my landlord's office to check, and the woman, when I asked her if the air gets shared at any point, replied somewhat unconvincingly ""I don't believe so"".

But I didn't realize for a few hours, and while I didn't like lick my bathtub, I'm wondering if a doubled concentration did anything at all. 

Is the old bottle a week more than a year old completely worthless, or if i increase concentration can I squeeze more use out of it while I look for newer stuff.

1406,People have lost their ever-loving minds about this virus ...,"Earlier I rode by a coffee shop with outdoor seating and it was packed with people, as if there wasn't a pandemic going on, in an area where the virus is very active and spreading.

This area has a number of dead, has put at least 10 times that many in the hospital, many on ventilators, etc ... yet nobody seems to care.

People have lost their minds.

Proof ... imagine if instead of it being a virus it was an active shooter going around gunning people down randomly and putting them on a ventilator, and that all the people dead where you live had actually been gunned down in the street.  How would everyone be acting then ?  If they knew that the gunman was most likely at a big box store, or other places where people congregate, and that the gunman could never be caught, and was walking around completely invisible ... do you think for a minute that MF'ers would be walking around as if nothing was going on ?

Imagine if terrorists had killed 100,000 people in this country and were continuing their killing right now, ... do you think assholes would be walking around enjoying the spring day walking their fucking dogs in the park and shit ?

And my biggest question....do you think it would be of benefit to me to move sooner rather than later? Part of me wants to see how this plays out and put it off as long as possible so maybe a treatment can be found in that time (wishful thinking, maybe), the other part of me is worried about cases rapidly increasing and that would scare me to move even more.

Mods, can we have one day a week where we just rage against these morons? 

I made a trip to Costco in Florida today. I am in a very privileged position where I’m living with my family during the pandemic while my husband is deployed. We have a young toddler. I am the only person to leave the house for things like curbside pickup and grocery shopping since the other family members have preexisting conditions and I am a healthcare professional not practicing right now. So of course my toddler stays with their grandparents while I venture out. My toddler and other vulnerable family members haven’t left the house since late March. 

There were so many mom and dad combos wearing masks while their babies weren’t wearing masks. WTF?!? And yes you read that right mom and dad were both in the store at the same time wearing masks?!? WHY ARENT ONE OF YOU STAYING HOME WITH THE BABY WHO CANT WEAR A MASK?!? On the one hand good on them for noting the suffocation hazard but come on. Normally I grocery shop on base (they also have a mask requirement) and I usually only see one baby. I’m assuming that one babies mother just PCSed  and didn’t have time to find a friend that she can trust to watch her child to go grocery shopping. That is an impossible position to be in. WHY DO BOTH OF YOU NEED TO GO SHOPPING. The worst was a family of four. Mom, dad, 1st child all wearing masks, baby no mask just babbling in the seat.

1409,Who wants to talk about what they miss the most?,"As a community, I believe that we all accept that the safest choice is to continue with social distancing and limiting visiting any unnecessary populated places, although I'm sure some of us practice to different degrees.

We as a group continue to support each other with reminders that this point in time as the world reopens is a very dangerous time. 

I'm of the belief that directly addressing things that are hard make them easier to deal with, so who wants to talk about what they miss? What are you missing out on, what do you wish you could do? What will you probably/definitely miss out on in the near future?

I'll start, although I'm sure I'll add more later as I think: our homeschool group has resumed activities, I miss including my son in those. I miss museums, taking a trip being an easy thing to think about, and thrifting, going different places enjoying talking with random nice people throughout the day, showing my son how nice some people can be to be around (and others not), and how day to day life really works. I miss walks where we meet up with neighbors and kids, as now we wave and walk the other way as it's too hard on the kids. Picking up certain items for projects has become a chore, and waiting for 3 in 1 oil at Lowe's pickup has stopped a project for 4 days. I miss family. Some we can see at a distance, others don't get it so we avoid them. We've missed one vacation, and the holidays as each comes will likely be different and even more obviously isolated from the ones we love.

1419,Basic First Aid Training for Times of Civil Unrest during Covid,"Hi all. As you all know, there is a risk of widespread, longterm civil unrest in many places in the US right now. I wanted to put together some basic first aid knowledge as a public service, to use in this time. I am not a medical professional, but a trained amateur.  Feel free to repost, share, blatantly plagiarize and distribute, etc. 

**Scope:**

* I am deliberately designing this to be an introduction to first aid, during a period of civil unrest, during a pandemic. 

**Provider Safety/ Scene Safety:** 

* This is beat into the heads of anybody responding to medical emergencies. You need to make sure it is safe to provide care. It is non-negotiable. If it not safe, you should not respond to the emergency. 
* If you mess this up, you yourself can experience injury or death, which will just add to the medical emergency. 
* During this time, a few expected scene hazards may be:
   * Active police and citizen violence.
   * Tear gas and pepper spray.
   * Fires.
   * Broken glass.
   * Traffic.
   * Live electricity.
   * COVID-19 transmission.
* Here is a video on scene safety: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvJbqAAMD9g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvJbqAAMD9g)

**Tips for managing a first aid emergency:**

* TL;DR -- take an active, assertive approach to managing bystanders. Use them as resources to help. Most people want to help out, if they're standing around. Tell them what to do. Ask someone if they can apply pressure, or if they can help form a barrier, if they can be active lookouts for hazards, etc.
* Steps to responding to an emergency -- 
   * 1) Tell someone to call 911. Be specific. Say ""You there in the red shirt, can you call 911 right now?"" Get a verbal confirmation that they are doing so. 
   * 2) Before approaching injured person, make sure the scene is safe.
   * 3) Introduce yourself as a first aider to the patient.
   * 4) Start patient assessment.
   * 5) Determine first aid response, and actively monitor the situation until healthcare providers arrive on scene. Get bystanders to help. 
   *  Here is Red Cross's First Aid Steps, which you should follow: [https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/first-aid/performing-first-aid/first-aid-steps](https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/first-aid/performing-first-aid/first-aid-steps)

**PPE:** 

* Because you will be breaking social distancing measures to respond to a first aid emergency, proper PPE is necessary. At least, you should have an N-95 and goggles, but we all know how likely that is these days. At bare, bare minimum you absolutely need a mask and eye protection. The skin is actually a fairly good barrier against blood-borne pathogens if you don't have gloves, but obviously wear gloves if you have them. If you have any open cuts on your hands, gloves are mandatory. 
* If you are in an area with active civil unrest, this is the PPE you should consider if you have to leave the house: [http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/city/how-to-gear-up/216551-what-to-wear-protest](http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/city/how-to-gear-up/216551-what-to-wear-protest)
   * To preserve a [grey man philosophy](https://www.itstactical.com/intellicom/mindset/gray-man-strategies-101-peeling-away-the-thin-veneer-of-society/), keep your mask and goggles in a bag, readily accessible, consider more nondescript running shoes, and if wearing knee pads, consider wearing UNDER your pants. 

**Basic First Aid Training:** 

* If you have the financial means, please take a Red Cross course. Right now they are doing online courses. Take a Standard first aid course, and CPR. Bare minimum, take Emergency First aid, and CPR.  [https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/first-aid/first-aid-training/first-aid-online](https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/first-aid/first-aid-training/first-aid-online)
* If you do not have the financial means, here is free online first aid training. Take the basic, then the advanced. The knowledge is limited, and you will learn more, correct stuff from Red Cross. Still better than nothing, however.: [https://www.firstaidforfree.com/free-first-aid-course/](https://www.firstaidforfree.com/free-first-aid-course/)
* Additionally to one of the above, I suggest investing in a basic first aid manual. Go through it on your own and make sure you know everything. Either a Red Cross manual, a Saint John Ambulance manual.
   * Here is a free, legal first aid manual PDF for download from Saint John Ambulance (Warning -- automatic download): [https://www.sja.ca/English/Courses-and-Training/Documents/First-aid-reference-guide\_V4.1\_Public.pdf](https://www.sja.ca/English/Courses-and-Training/Documents/First-aid-reference-guide_V4.1_Public.pdf)

**Trauma First Aid Training:** 

* Here is a short version of Stop the Bleed training, which was developed by the American College of Surgeons: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLLXy3AsBQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGLLXy3AsBQ) 
* Here is a video demonstrating more hands-on skills for a stop the bleed course: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FBIydzl1Ss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FBIydzl1Ss)
* To supplement the above, here are a few basic skills:
   * How to use a tourniquet -- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWVne7cUrm8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWVne7cUrm8) 
   * Misconceptions about tourniquets -- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r50-lWDsmcI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r50-lWDsmcI)
   * How to fold and stage a tourniquet -- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSECJQPJmLw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSECJQPJmLw)
   * BUY A CoTCCC-APPROVED TOURNIQUET. This is non-negotiable. At worse, you will only occlude VENOUS blood flow, but not arterial blood flow and cause severe tissue damage. i.e., you will kill the casualty faster. 
   * How to pack a wound -- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XieRLnynqhA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XieRLnynqhA)
* Basic abdominal trauma care -- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebkQtGAqfis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebkQtGAqfis)
* Inserting an NPA -- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaVLSsIxT4Y&amp;list=PL4AEqniepshZl05q2CK3H2tDNSXCLhI8S&amp;index=5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaVLSsIxT4Y&amp;list=PL4AEqniepshZl05q2CK3H2tDNSXCLhI8S&amp;index=5)
* The Prep Medic First Aid Playlist -- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XieRLnynqhA&amp;list=PLEbg9C7jKDnLxjoACm3vDe0wWBDpwX5I\_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XieRLnynqhA&amp;list=PLEbg9C7jKDnLxjoACm3vDe0wWBDpwX5I_)
* Basics of shock -- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t\_RLS6sSFrE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_RLS6sSFrE)
* How to take vitals -- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtPQFWkgaI0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtPQFWkgaI0)
* There is lots to this, but the above is a good place to start. Learn all of it and you will be considerably better than most people with basic first aid certification. 

**Situation-Specific First Aid Emergencies:**

Here are some injuries that are possible/ likely to occur during periods of civil unrest:

* Overview of dehydration; very common and likely; potentially very dangerous -- [https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/153363](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/153363) 
   * DIY oral rehydration salts -- [https://rehydrate.org/solutions/homemade.htm](https://rehydrate.org/solutions/homemade.htm)
* Overview of a panic attack -- [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/panic-attacks/symptoms-causes/syc-20376021](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/panic-attacks/symptoms-causes/syc-20376021)

**Building a First Aid Kit:**

* In general, only carry what you know what to use/ have the authority to use. 
* I advocate for building a kit, instead of buying an assembled kit. You will save a lot of money and have total control. 
   * You can always buy a kit, as well. If so, consider North American Rescue, H&amp;H Med Corp, or a supplier that is intended for professional first responders. 
* How to build a homemade first aid kit -- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH\_X3oxl03E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH_X3oxl03E)
* How to build a car first aid kit --  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1s-XtgffZ4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1s-XtgffZ4)
* Opinions vary WIDELY on first aid kits. That said, here is a suggestion for a minimal, civil-unrest-specific first aid kit to carry when you travel through dangerous areas.
   * First aid pouch. You will need a small, clamshell-style EMT pouch or IFAK. There are lots of them available. Go for one that is as small as possible to carry all of your supplies in an organized manner, so you actually bring it with you. 
      * \`IMO you should avoid camo patterns, and other ""tacti-cool"" designs. Regardless of your political views, this paints you as a specific kind of person which at least one group of protestors will not like. Blend in. Camo is not for urban environments. Go for a red bag or a black bag. 
      * Here are a few examples of what you should look for: [https://store.itstactical.com/collections/first-aid-pouches](https://store.itstactical.com/collections/first-aid-pouches)
   * 1-2x CoTCCC rated tourniquets. I like the CAT tourniquet because it is easier for self-application. 
   * 2x vented chest seals. 
   * 1-2x non-clinging compressed gauze (like this: [https://www.narescue.com/gauze-s-rolled-4-5-x-4-1-yd.html](https://www.narescue.com/gauze-s-rolled-4-5-x-4-1-yd.html))
   * 1x 28 Fr. NPA
   * 1x compression bandage (the smaller, the better, like this -- [https://buyhandh.com/products/h-bandage-compression-dressing](https://buyhandh.com/products/h-bandage-compression-dressing))
   * Several sizes of small adhesive bandages
   * 2x triangular bandages
   * 10' of Duct tape.
   * 1x roll of non-latex medical tape.
   * 6x 500mg tabs of ibuprofen.
   * 3 days of any of your RX meds.
   * 2x 325mg tabs of aspirin. 
   * 30g table salt, non-iodized.
   * Plastic bags or water bottle.
   * (Optional but helpful) A Pulse oximeter 
   * (Optional, but helpful) some basic EMT shears. If not, carry a multi-tool with scissors.
   * (Optional, but not really) a small penlight. If not, carry a flashlight capable of very low lumen output.
   * Regular Covid-19 PPE. 

**Final Takeaways:**

* Avoidance, preparation, and safety are your best strategies. Sit low, sit tight, avoid dangerous situations.
* This is not comprehensive, it is meant to be an introduction to some of these concepts.
* Good, basic first aid skills will go a long way. If you have to pick one thing to learn, learn those. 
* I am not a medical professional, and this is not intended as medical advice. I am just a trained amateur/ first aid nerd. 
* Feel free to add stuff I missed, comment, ask questions, etc.

1422,COVID-19 Orphans: What do you think this population will look like in the next year or two?,"The Spanish Flu killed an unusually large percentage of young adults, potentially due to some immunity of the elderly population conferred by prior epidemics (link 1). As a result, millions of children were orphaned. I've seen numbers like 10-12 million orphans just on the African continent for example resulted from the pandemic (link 2 is that even possible? I'm not a numbers person). 

Obviously we've had deaths in the US and worldwide, including young parents. But to what degree do you think children have already and will be in the near future left without guardians? I realize this involves a bit of crystal balling, but I feel like it's a significant impact on the world along with the financial aspect. If large numbers of children could be orphaned (by losing young parents or their grandparent guardians) in the face of a dramatic second peak, that is a significant thing to consider and prep for if it would fit your plans.

Many of us add additional preps for giving out to those in need, trading, etc, but what do you see the orphan count looking like?

If anyone wants to help me do the links better I'd be grateful :)

My town is holding a BLM rally on Friday, which I feel compelled to go to. I don't think it will turn violent, although I hear people from out of town may be there. I believe we can maintain social distancing, unlike in the cities. I just plan to stand in my spot and hold a sign, march if we do that, but I'm not there to make friends lol.

I have a valveless N95 which I plan on taping to my face, at least at the top, to ensure seal and keep me from removing it. I also have a P100 3M vapor mask (paint mask, the one with the bright pink filters). Am I correct in assuming exhaled breath is NOT filtered? (In which case, I won't wear it)

I really don't want to wear goggles, but I will wear glasses that will be sanitized after.

I have plenty of hand sani and am planning on bringing a full pump bottle with me and using it all lol.

My ID will be in a fanny pack and I will not take anything out of it. My phone will be sanitized after. My keys will be in my pocket. I'll probably have a small bag to keep water etc in which I'll toss after.

I plan on leaving my shoes outside when I get home, probably wiping the bottoms of my feet with Clorox wipes, then heading straight for the shower where I will put my clothes into a garbage bag and hop directly into the shower. My shoes will probably end up being set in the sun for a day or three. (I don't plan on wearing ""good"" shoes.)

I am not in a hotspot area; we have some confirmed, maybe a few deaths in the area, but nothing like a lot of other areas.

1429,Need advice and input - should I (immunocompromised) park in my tandem driveway (where my neighbors have full access to my car to move it) or on the street (city street in a neighborhood that is generally safe but does have frequent issues)?,"I am immunocompromised and am trying to do everything I can to social distance, but it’s very hard in the city. I can’t take out my trash or get my mail or keep my window open without encountering many people, masked and unmasked. 

My lease requires me to keep my car keys in the shared foyer space if I use the shared driveway so that the neighbors can move my car when they need to. The neighbors I share the driveway with have a small child and I have never seen any of them wear a mask.  Ever. And they are always outside playing in the street where people are always passing by and walking, they are always leaving and going places, and every weekend they invite random people to our shared yard and sit around and drink. They don’t practice social distancing. And for many other reasons unrelated to this, they are inconsiderate neighbors. And I know most people do not have a good sense of hygiene. 

I had always kept disinfectant wipes in my car prior to covid and would wipe down the steering wheel, buttons, levers, and door handles whenever she would move my car. Since February, I stopped parking in the driveway and started parking on the street to avoid any potential contamination of my car. I don’t trust them. I also don’t trust them with my car. Witnessed her almost get it hit once. Leave my car on the street instead of putting It back in the driveway. And the previous tenant told me they ripped her steering wheel. 

However, with the weather getting warmer, and increasing looting and damage being done all across the nation, as well as in my city, I am more concerned about parking on the street. People frequently enter unlocked cars (I’m usually good at locking but I’m not immune to forgetting), steal tires, and steal packages on this street. I’m close to a main hub and also on a fairly Main Street, so there’s a lot of car, foot, and bike traffic. Lots of homeless people in this area too, not that I’m attributing them to the stealing as I think most of that has come from more privileged folks, but I have heard stories (unverified) of homeless people walking the streets and trying to open cars. Oh there’s also a protest close to me tomorrow. 

I feel unsafe either way and am not sure what is best. Park in the driveway and risk contamination, but just take extra precautions every time I enter my car / wear a mask even while driving to have better assurance that my car is safe. Or park on the street and worry about someone damaging my car or stealing. Also street cleaning tickets and hit and runs, or bikers doing something stupid always keep me on edge too while parking on the street. 

Additionally, I have to get my car serviced next week so my car feels like it’s going to get contaminated anyway, so should I just suck it up and park in the driveway to have more peace of mind with respect to car safety? 

Part of me also wants to just park in the driveway and not leave my keys in the shared space so that whenever they want to use their car and I am on the outside, they have to call me and I move my car myself. But these people are alwayyyys in and out. All the time. I would never be able to shower or do anything. Would always have to be checking my phone. It’s not realistic. And I’d be violating the terms of my lease.

1432,Grocery store limits are lifting... but for how long?,"This week I was pleasantly surprised to learn that my grocery store lifted limits on meat. (Midatlantic US.)

Before the meat shortages and limits hit, we did have a stock of meat, but our freezer was basically full and there was nothing more we could store. I got lucky and scored a chest freezer so we can finally store even more meat.

We had to start getting more creative. We mostly ate chicken, but we started mixing in more beef and pork since my store has limits per meat type. We try to order grocery delivery only every 2 weeks since fees are high, so it was hard to add anything to our stash.

But the limits were lifted, so woohoo! I ordered 6 family packs of chicken thighs, not knowing for sure if that would be allowed or even in stock, but my Instacart shopper delivered 27 lbs of chicken thighs. I repackaged them all and put them into our chest freezer. I'm stoked! Oh, and we also got more pork shoulders and ground beef.

We did this thinking that... well, it's been 2 weeks since Memorial Day parties. And now with the protests, there will surely be another spike.

1439,Freezer storage question,"I’ve only been prepping since covid hit. I can figure out alternatives to most things. But I am at my wits end on one thing, and it is so trivial but it is driving me crazy. 

I buy fresh fruits and veggies to freeze and blanch them. I’ve bought meats and deboned or portioned out to freeze. My freezer is full. I’m using gallon and quart size ziplocks. I already have dry preps, so the solution isn’t buy canned goods. 

I live in an urban area and don’t have space for a chest freezer. So my door freezer is my only option. I have everything stacked and balanced in there until I want something that has other stuff on top of it. 

The problem isn’t that I’m a bad stacker. It’s that the ziplocks are slick and everything slips off of each other when they aren’t supported. I’ve tried freezing things flat and then adding them to the stack but they end up being like a smooth paver still and then avalanche. 

How do you guys freeze food as to avoid this? I know I can buy a different freezer or a different fridge. That’s not my question. Is there a better way to organize and stack my frozen food?

1450,Prepping for Summer Storms,"I get some minor flooding and a few power outages each summer.  Luckily up to this point they have been brief and our sump pump backup battery combined with leaving the freezers closed had been enough.

With everything going on in the world, the extra meat on hand and my expectations of things getting worse we are getting a generator and transfer switch installed this week so I dont have to run extension cords all over the house or behind big appliances.

Decided to go with the Westinghouse 7500 Dual Fuel (already ordered so I can't change that). If we lose power the plan is to wait 2-3 hours.  If it is not back on then fire up the generator using the propane option (so I dont have to clean the carb afterward) running it a few hours on and few hours off and if power stays out for 2-3 days then switch to gas which provides better fuel economy. 

Curious about your opinions of this plan or anyone who has done something similar to see how I can improve.  I also have alternate fuel/stove and canning supplies if I need to can all of the meat for a longer term situation.

But yeah, so long as you wash well for the right amount of time, body wash can totally cover it - it still has the necessary chemistry to break down the outside of the virus, and generates the same kind of physical forces that remove dirt, which is all you need.

1479,potentially developing a sixth poo sense due to covid? please advise,"hey, something weird happened to me and id like to pose this to the forum and reddit community at large. as you all know, were in the midst of a covid outbreak and the cdc and other bullsh\*t health organizations have advised people to wear masks at all times. that means even when youre taking a sh\*t.

im back in the workplace now and have been wearing a mask every time i go to take a sh\*t. the setup at my place of business is a communal bathroom shared with several other companies, and i dont want to catch anything, including covid, hence the mask. anyways, one thing i noticed is that now that i wear a mask when i sh\*t, i cant smell my poo as it comes out of my butt, and i find myself forgetting whether or not ive actually pooed. its like the poo scent is necessary for knowing if ive grinded one out yet or not, and the scent's removal is confusing my brain. im effectively having to look down between my legs, past my balls, and at the toilet bowl to see if theres any poo in there yet or not.

anyways, the lighting is super bad in this bathroom, so its hard to actually see the poo. short of reaching down with my hand to feel whether or not theres poo in the bowl yet, i frequently just cant see. i started reaching down in the bowl to feel for the poo but then my boss got mad at me for it and yelled at me so i had to stop. i was feeling lost but then the craziest thing happened - what im discovering is that im now developing this aural awareness of whether the poo has actually hit porcelain yet or not. its like ive developed a sixth sense. or it might be just an enhanced sense that already existed, like when a person goes blind midway through their life and all of a sudden can cum for days when they climax - like i always had this capability but had never discovered it yet.

Do not be caught in any indoor area with other people without a mask for any longer than a brief encounter. Go grocery shopping as little as possible. Do not go inside anyone’s house or let anyone in yours. Eating in a restaurant or going to a bar would be a really fucking stupid thing to do right now.

1481,How do you deal with friends and family who want to visit?,"It seems like so many people are pushing for things to get ""back to normal"" when clearly, they are not and will not be for maybe a year or more. 

My parents are clearly going stir crazy. I can tell that they really want to see me. We were supposed to have a family party at the end of May to celebrate my wedding. (We got married in March in a small private ceremony.) That obviously got canceled.

I was talking to my mom last night and she suggested going on a trip somewhere remote together. They are planning some trips to remote rural areas to get away. I made the excuse that my work won't allow anyone to travel out of state (not entirely true but believable). But then they hinted at visiting here too... I really don't want to hurt her feelings, but I'm not comfortable seeing anyone other than my spouse right now.

My friends are also planning some ""socially distanced"" gatherings where they sit on lawn chairs outside 6 ft apart.  They're trying to make it safe, but honestly, I can't sit outside for hours in the heat with no bathroom access. That just sounds miserable. I also still don't really feel comfortable hanging out in person, even if outside and six feet apart, because some of them have to physically go to work. I made excuses about being busy for this next gathering.

I suppose I should probably just be honest about not feeling comfortable. How can I set a boundary in a way that shows that I care about them, but it's not safe right now?

1485,My friend was made to come into work--knowing that she could possibly have COVID-19-- then was fired.,"I'm relatively new--so I wasn't really sure what sub to post this in--but I have a really urgent question:

My friend and I both work in the restaurant industry. In my state, most restaurants are following CDC guidelines and requiring their servers to wear masks. However, both of the restaurants my friend and I work at don't require us to wear masks. In fact, the restaurant that I work at downright refuses to let the servers wear masks. They think it brings down the vibe and doesn't go with the companies aesthetic. I told my owners/managers that I didn't feel comfortable not wearing a mask, so they allowed me temporary leave so that I could collect unemployment. I'm the only server they've done this for (because I'm the only one who expressed discomfort) and I'm super grateful; it really shows me how much they care about me and value me as an employee.

On the other hand, my friend works at a restaurant who's management could not care less about CDC guidelines. The day that our state shutdown non-essential businesses, they secretly stayed open because the GM didn't ""see the big deal"". So, yeah, the management truly doesn't care about any of the guidelines. They don't impliment social distancing, they don't require masks, they don't sanitize... they just flat out don't care; they think this whole thing is a hoax.

So, two weeks ago, my friend had relations with a guy--who had previously had relations with a girl--who wound up being tested positive for the virus. When the guy told my friend that the girl he was with before her had the virus, he told my friend that he was going to get tested and so should she. At this point my friend was beginning to experience symptoms--fever, nausea, loss of smell. That very next day he got his test results back and, sure enough, he'd tested positive. My friend then relayed this crazy story to her GM, let's call the lady Karen, and told Karen that she couldn't work her next shift, which was on a Sunday. Karen told her that she had to come into work anyways, and that she would just have to wear a mask. So, my friend, very reluctantly went to work because she was afraid that she might be fired if didn't show up. She has asthma and already has a hard time breathing, so she'd take her mask off occasionally to take a deep breath. The manager interacted with her several times whilst not having the mask on, but didn't correct her. The very next day, Monday, she went to a clinic to get tested. The nurse, administering the test, asked my friend ifvshe'd worked since the onset of her symptoms. My friend explained that her manager had made her come to into work, despite informing the manager of being exposed. The nurse was shocked and decided to put a rush on my friend's test results so she'd have documentation to give to the manager (the nurse told my friend that normally the test results come back in 4-5 days, unless you pay to get the results expedited).

 So, the very next day, the nurse emailed my friend her test results--stating that she had tested positive and that she could not return to work for at least 2 weeks. My friend then texted a screenshot of the test results to Karen, who continued to make light of it. So, my friend texted another manager screenshots of her conversation with Karen, to see what they had to say about it. Apparently, Karen hadn't let ANYONE know that my friend could possibly have the virus. So, then, my friend created a group chat with all the servers, letting them know that she had just tested positive and was made to work on Sunday. The ones who had worked with her that Sunday were extremely upset, and one girl said that she'd been feeling super off, but figured it was just allergies. Well, turns out, this girl now has the virus as well. So, my friend definitely passed it on to her. 

Earlier today, the girl put in her resignation because she's so upset at the blatant lack of concern for exposing not only the employees, but the public. The girl texted the owner to let him know that my friend's situation should've been announced. He downright lied and told this girl that my friend never came into work during her exposure. So, my friend just tried to log onto to schedulefly (it's an app that servers use to access their schedules) and her account has been cancelled. So, she's basically bern terminated. Except no one even called her to inform her of this. She was receiving partial unemployment because of restaurant workers being so heavily impacted by the pandemic, so now she's scared she won't receive unemployment anymore.

I'm like a.) You'll definitely get unemployment, you've been wrongfully terminated and b.) You have a lawsuit on your hands.

Does anyone have any advice on how she should proceed?",PandemicPreps,1592965910,bkjohnson1989,17,1,True,2020-06-23 19:31:50,relatively new really sure sub post really urgent question friend work

1486,Frustrated with this level of prepped. I want my space back. Please tell me why you believe heavy prepping is important right now.,"We're a family of three with one of us having food allergies. So it's import to ensure we've got enough selection for that reason. We have somewhere over 400 lbs of rice, somewhere over 300 lbs of beans (I stopped counting and it's still not all on mylar.) And apparently that's still not a year for 3 people. We have a huge chest freezer (7-8' long) full of mostly meat, 4 shelving units of food, some chips/cereal, some canned and dry fruit, lots of canned beans, coconut milk, canned meat, it goes on and on. In mylar we also have flour, gluten free flour, cornmeal, oats...We have so much personal protection and spare loaded magazines. First aid. Home supplies.

I use a container of something and I'm very tempted to just not replace it.

I know there's a lot going on here in the US, but in my little quarantine world it just seems like we're still hunkered at home while the world largely carries on as normal, granted with increasing cases in some states (which isn't a big deal anymore according to how people act) and some rioting, but do we need to be stocked for a year still?

1487,Family Keeps Hosting BBQs,"Hi,

My husband I are living with extended family because the housing situation around here is crazy.

Almost everyone in our home is immunocompromised including myself and my husband.  I'm going to be having a major surgery in four months and it's really important that I don't get sick. 

However, the family has had three BBQs this month and are very upset that we are still trying to isolate ourselves.  We have told them that we feel unsafe in our home, and they are choosing to do this anyway.  They were angry that we chose to stay in our room the first time and not talk to anyone. I got put on blast in a group chat had to apologize for being rude. 

The second time we did the same but my husband had to go out of our room to apologize to everyone which exposes him and ultimately my son and I.  

The third time we took off to a hotel for a few nights to avoid the whole thing all together.  And now we're avoiding going back home even though we need to today because we got called assholes for that too.  It's very frustrating and we are not in a position to move right now so we have to somehow protect ourselves and keep the peace. 

I read this article today about a family getting sick at these parties and it freaks me out that the mom who dropped stuff off on the porch also caught it.  

Is there any hope for us to protect ourselves?  Any advice for when we go back to the house?

1504,Let's talk generators.,"I live in a state that gets hit by a hurricane every few years. In my 2 decades living here, we've lost power a few times, and once had no power for 3 weeks in August. 

I've never owned a generator before. We never felt like we needed one. But now i have a freezer full of meat. And I'm concerned if power goes out it will be longer to repair due to the virus, due to electric company workers being sick. 

What wattage do i need? If i just want to run a fridge/freezer combo? What if I wanted to add a window ac unit on?

Are dual fuel generators worth it? Should I go with gas only? How do i store gas safely? How long can I store gasoline?

Besides fuel and the generator itself, what else do i need? Oil? Spark plugs? A chain and lock to secure it on the back deck? A better security option? 

How long will a generator last if I dont need to use it? Can it sit in my garage for 5 years? 10 years? How can I make sure my generator lasts?

Safety tips for a generator? I know never to run it inside or in the garage, but how far should it be from windows? Is it safe to rest the unit on grass that may be damp? Should I keep my fire extinguisher near it?

I'm a healthcare worker entering the battle against COVID. I'm extremely thankful for finding this community of like-minded individuals who actually seem to be taking the pandemic seriously. 

My situation is this: I've just moved into a 2 bedroom apartment with my wife and (2 year old) child. Needless to say my worst fear in the world right now is bringing the virus home and harming either one of them. I am taking one bedroom and bathroom, and my wife and child are taking the living room, kitchen, the other bedroom and bath. We're planning on staying completely separated for as long as this virus is a threat. 

I was looking for ideas or thoughts on creating a more secure quarantine zone for myself to minimize possible transmission as much as possible. Any tips or ideas would greatly be appreciated.

1515,Struggling to find movers who will wear masks,"I have posted on here previously about the fact that I have a move coming at the end of July (unavoidable, for work) that will be a move across several states. Since nearly every moving company in my area wanted to put my stuff on a truck with items from other households, I decided the safest route would be to hire to movers where I am now to load a uhaul, have a trusted friend drive the uhaul while I drive my car, and have two movers unload it on the other end. 

The problem, is that in contacting movers, most seem to say that they will wear masks for the walk through, but not while they are actually moving items since it is hot an uncomfortable for them. I’m very high risk with two high risk health issues in this pandemic, and I’m absolutely terrified I will die or end up in the hospital on a ventilator as a result of this move. 

I’m planning to have the windows open in both apartments with fans going while the movers are inside, but I’m not sure if that’s enough to mitigate risks. I don’t own a lot, so it should only take the movers about an hour at each location. 

Thoughts on movers who refuse to wear masks? How risky is it? Would you keep looking for movers who will wear masks or would you just do the walk through and get out of the house while they unload without masks? Any tips or suggestions?

1520,Hoarding vs Prepping,"I wanted to touch on this topic because I think in this is one of the most misunderstood and confusing parts of preparing.

I want to start by defining terms:

Prepping: Having the skills and supplies needed to sustain yourself over a specific period of time

Stockpile: the amount of a consumable goods you will need for the time you are prepping for, no more or less

Hoarding: Keeping more than is required by your stockpile

There are a few things I’m assuming in this post: 

1. Most people in this sub are preparing based on their current lifestyle - that means using TP, earring certain foods, and not changing the means and quantity used of water and electricity

2. Most people in this sub are planning to stay in their home and the purpose of their prepping is to minimize outside contact until the pandemic is over.

3. Most people in this sub have been spending a bit more money than usual, and have probably crossed the line of prepping vs hoarding at least once

4. Most people in this thread are not able to self-sustain for very long, never mind indefinitely. This is not an insult - self-sustaining requires things like land, a specific skill set, and a wide variety of niche knowledge. It also assumes that you do not need any medical supplies or equipment to sustain your own life.

5. Most people in this sub are not prepping for more than 12 months, with 3 months being the most common.

I am not saying these are 100% true premises as there are always exceptions, but these are the premises this post is operating from for the purpose of this sub.

——————————
I. Needs Assessment
——————————

With prepping, you need to know when to stop. There is an actual upper limit to every material good you could need to be prepared. The only thing there is not an upper limit to is skills. You can always learn more about first aid, how to entertain yourself, how to stay connected, and how to stay busy in a healthy way.

So what is the upper limit for a consumable good? It’s the amount you intend to use during whatever period of time you are intending to prepare for. A needs assessment will tell you exactly how much of something you actually need, so that you can get a quantity that is reasonable. This saves you money and frees up supplies for others who need it.

Let’s do an example needs assessment for something everyone should have (unless you’re allergic) during a pandemic: Tylenol

Tylenol comes in lots of sizes, but an average store brand extra strength acetaminophen (generic tylenol) will come in bottles 500. Two bottles of Tylenol can be up to 1,000 pills - at 2 pills a dose, you are looking at 500 doses. Assuming you take two pills every 4 hours, that is 8 pills a day. 2 standard bottles of Tylenol is a 125 day supply of the maximum dose of Tylenol. That is enough for a 14 day supply for 8 adults.

Assuming 2 adults in a household, and assuming each adult gets COVID, the flu, and another miscellaneous virus, 2 bottles of Tylenol are more than enough while still leaving room for any children who will need a much lower dose.

Based on this needs assessment, a reasonable one year stockpile of Tylenol for two adults and a child is 2 bottles of 500 pills. Anything more than that is hoarding.

——————————————
II. Observe what you consume 
——————————————

I have a hypothesis that the primary reason people are hoarding goods is because they are 1. Afraid and 2. Have no clue how much they truly consume. They just know that there are certain products they regularly consume, and don’t want to run out of.

Do you know offhand how long a roll of toilet paper lasts you? Are you sure? Have you ever actually tracked your consumption habits?

To know what you need, you need to observe what you use. I see families smaller than mine say they are going through one roll every 3-4 days, while one roll lasts us on average 5-6 days.

Brains are very bad at estimating. Written logs are the way around it. Maybe it sounds absurd to write down every time you change the TP roll, but that’s the only way you’ll know what you truly need. Observing for one month will give you a more accurate average, but for now just keep track of the next couple rolls. You may be shocked to find out how long it lasts you.

My family needs approximately 75 rolls of toilet paper a year. For an entire year. A three month supply is about 19 rolls. That’s two packs of 12 or one 20-pack. A two week supply is less than 5 rolls, even assuming above normal use.

Having your needs met is fine. Keeping stuff you don’t need is hoarding.

You can extend this to any consumable good. How many jars of pasta sauce do you need? [what you use in 1 weeks] x [how many weeks you want to be prepared for]

—————————————————
III. Supply chain disruption =/= supply chain collapse (AKA inconvenience is not an emergency)
—————————————————

The best prep you can have for this specific situation is the ability to be flexible in what you consume. Odds are that you will still be able to order some maintenance goods, just as we were able to over the last shutdowns. This means longer delivery times, higher prices, and less variety, but that’s different from a shutdown. 

This means if you have a 2-week prep, your window to restock yourself is 2 weeks. If you have a 3 month stock, you have 3 months to get everything ready for the next 3 months. During a crisis your stockpiles may get smaller, meaning it’s both possible and likely that your 3 month stockpile may slowly turn into a 1 month stockpile based on the availability of goods.

Does that sound scary? Let me word it a different way: your peeps are going to last you for longer than you are prepping for unless the supply chain completely collapses.

Remember premise 4? We are not planning indefinite preps. I am personally far more worried I will get into a car accident while driving my toddler to sleep and die waiting at a hospital that is over capacity than I am about having to cook steel cut oats instead of having my nice and convenient 1-minute oats.

This part of prepping requires you to know your priorities and be resilient to change. The last thing you want to do is get to your last jar of peanut butter, fall into despair, and then go over to your grocery store and buy 8 jars because you are convinced you’ll die without it. (subtext: and then get your peanut butter with a side of COVID) That may sound dramatic, but we are slamming face first into a mental health crisis, and if you convince yourself that your survival hinges on having a specific product or a specific brand, you’re going to believe that and have a deeply visceral reaction when forced to go without it or go to an alternative product/brand.

Maybe you can’t get fresh bread for a bit - that sucks, but it won’t kill you. Maybe you run out of peanut butter. Oh well! Maybe you have to stop eating cereal because you can’t get fresh milk. You’ll live. You need to tell yourself this regularly. Be thankful for what you do have as this helps resilience - this is a good time to say thanks before meals, even if the person you’re thanking is yourself.

The only reasonable exception I can think of is a person with truly stringent dietary needs. Sensory eating disorders (and adults in recovery from eating disorders) in young children, celiac, colitis, allergies, formulas, etc fall into this category. In that case, go back to part II and do a needs assessment to figure out how much of a specific food you genuinely need. If you have a feeding plan from a doctor, you need to consider that plan a medical necessity and apply this section to things like toilet paper, OTC medications, and other consumables.

But for the rest of us? Food counts for this. Same with toilet paper. Unless your doctor has told you otherwise for your specific medical condition, acetaminophen is Tylenol. Ibuprofen is Advil. Generics get there job done. If you need to wipe your butt with 1-ply Scott’s TP, you will be fine. The point of a pandemic prep is to help you go from top off to top off while also minimizing your risk of exposure.

If you are considering a situation where every supply chain collapses beyond functioning for an extended period of time, you are looking at SHTF prepping, not pandemic prepping.

I hope this helps some of you sort out your preps. Remember to know your priorities and plan around them, but be mentally flexible enough that you don’t have a crisis over peanut butter and put yourself at risk.

1521,Respirator - Reusable full face vs half face vs disposable,"Wondering if I could get some advice. I have a small amount of n95 disposable respirators from a painting project I did last year. I found a store locally that has reusable half face and full face respirators in stock, so I was thinking of getting a set. My inclination was to go full face so it provides the most protection. These would be my worst case scenario backup masks, in the event that things got really bad and I had to bug out or something. So my question is:

1. What kind of filters would I need? I see Organic Vapor/P100, Organic Vapor/Acid Gas/P100, and Multiple Gases/Vapor/P100. 
2. Is it worth it to get full face over half face?
3. Is it worth it to get reusable respirators while available?

1524,"When it happens, it will happen fast","I see a lot of people talking about 'the current lull' and 'warning signs of when things will get bad again'.

My county, which includes a city, went from single digit new cases a day and a test positivity rate of 2% to 233 cases a day and test positivity rate over 11% in about a week. They predict it will get worse before it gets any better. We had our first zero new case day less than two weeks ago, and now we're shutting down dine in and considering stay at home orders again.

Now, this doesn't mean people are panic buying again yet, but I have no plans on going out to the store again to check.  I did a big shop a few days ago, later than I would have wanted, but I couldn't go any sooner or I'd need to go out again to get med refills I'll be floating on for 3 months.

(The contact tracing they've managed here is showing bars, restaurants, and house parties as the main drivers, with plenty of unknown spread, but not a lot of protest presence in the people testing - probably because they are outdoors and masks were pretty enforced at the ones around here.)

I feel quite lucky that my local government acted fast on shutting some things down again (why were casino's ever open?)  but its only for a week now. And not every area will - whether thats good or bad in your opinion depends on what you still need when things start to look bad, I guess.

But if you are currently in a lull, don't assume it will last. Remember how fast things escalated in northern Italy? Yeah, that's still how its happening. Our surveillance on this thing and people's obedience to guidelines is piss poor. And by the time the spike shows, remember, its showing things that happened 2-3 weeks ago. By the time hospitals start to fill, that's like a month or more out from what's causing it and will take another several weeks even with swift action to slow down.

These pesky incubation periods, lag times, and exponential growth. Don't forget about it, as much as literally everyone on the news and many in power seem to, constantly.

So TL;DR

If you have a lull now::  
1) be careful still (though I know most everyone here is), you won't know if the wave is building until it starts to crest  
2) don't assume the lull will last. If it ends, it may very well end fast and suddenly.  
3) Remember that once it does start, even if there is swift action, it will get worse before it gets better, and you don't know how long it will last. It's up to you to debate if that means riding on what you have or going out one final time.

Couldn’t find it anywhere! Including in combination flu medicine like Theraflu. The one place I located it that would ship was at Staples.com. So I purchased an office size a pack of 50 individually wrapped sets. I spent $30 bucks on Tylenol then for what I was able to purchase today for $2 at Target.

1529,The ONE thing I didn’t prep for!,"I am a single 53-year-old but young and crazy woman with four cats, who has been casually prepping for most of the last 20 years, going back to when I lived in a tiny apartment in a nearby city with one pet. It was actually concern about the Y2K bug that got me started, and then it helped me survive the dot-com crash and 18 months of recessionary unemployment shortly after. There have been numerous experiences in my life where having a good supply of food, medical things, prescriptions, cat food etc. have come in handy when others have been in more dire straits. I never have to panic buy for weather events either. 

The only time it failed me was when I was in the middle of a move to a place about 30 miles away. All of my emergency gear was in a box and I took it to the new place as I slowly relocated myself. And then we had a big blizzard and power failure at the old place and I smugly said “Aha! but I have... oh shit, did I actually move that box already?!” The gods laugh. 

Anyway - back to present. I started to see the writing on the wall in January with what was going on in Asia (and not happening in the US) laid in a bunch of stuff to make sure I was prepared to shelter in place without any outings for shopping for a while, and then by mid March, my office closed and we were all sent home to work. I never left the house for 6 weeks, and I’ve mostly been alone with the critters since, with a few grocery deliveries and a few masked ventures out recently for re-supplies. 

Yesterday I realized something. The one thing I didn’t think to get before this pandemic, the one thing that matters and I didn’t get, was another human to ride it out with!! Isn’t that silly? But, like... I have this 1500 square foot house with a ton of space, beautiful gardens, a massive fully fenced vegetable garden, space for a workshop and food stores, and dang it, I forgot to add a man to my preps! LOL. After 4 months alone here I wish I’d managed to at least lay up someone of my own species to talk to 😆

Of course, I’m being silly… This is much better than being stuck with someone I don’t like or enjoy. But it was a comical thought to have and while everyone in my neighborhood and my family hold their independence day super spreader barbecues to celebrate their freedom to catch coronavirus and I sit here looking out into a beautiful garden talking to myself and the cats, I wanted to share.

You’re way better off storing good old isopropyl alcohol, hydrogen peroxide,bleach or just plain old soap. They are much cheaper, effective and much easier to store.

1544,The Most Uncomfortable Prep I’ve Ever Had to Make,"I’m a teacher in a southern state that, by law, will start schools for at least the first five days in full attendance face to face.  I watched my district’s school board meeting this evening about beginning school in August - they don’t even have a plan yet. My first workday is August 1st. I am immunosuppressed. 

My states’ cases are rising. Only about 50% of people are wearing masks, despite a state mandate. It’s expected to get worse before it gets better. 

I called an estate lawyer today and made an appointment for next week to create an ironclad will, living will, medical power of attorney, and power of attorney. 

I got a safety deposit box, made copies of my life insurance information, and put them in it.  I will put all the other legal paperwork in it and another copy in the fire-safe safe in the house once it’s done.

1547,"Moving during a pandemic and won’t have my stuff for two months. As far as preps go, what should I focus on first.","I’ve been prepping ever since 9/11, so I have a good idea of things. Having said that, I’m moving across the country for a new job, to a state that is seeing exponential growth in cases (Texas). I have family there but plan on self quarantining for two weeks, even though my current state only has a few cases. We will stay in a hotel for the first week and then move into our house. I won’t have any household goods until the end of September. 


Right now, I’m so focused on the immediate things and haven’t given much thought to possible scenarios we may encounter. All of my mental energy is spent doing normal move things like turning on utilities, figuring out how to enroll my kids into school, etc. Here’s my plan:


1. Food. I will be starting with a completely bare kitchen. I have some basic items on my shopping list but it’s not nearly enough for a family of four. I’ve ordered pots and pans and need to order plates and cups. I have paper plates/bowls on my shopping list. 


2.  Medicine. I’ll fly over with a first aid kit. I have Tylenol, a thermometer and gloves on my shopping list. 


3.  Water. When prepping in Texas, water is a concern. I have a couple of gallons on my shopping list. I’ll add more every time I shop. 


4. Entertainment. I have ordered two small TVs so that the kids can play video games. I plan on flying over with cards and light weight board games. My new house has a back yard with a swing set. 


5. Sanitation. I have cleaning supplies on my shopping list. I’ll have delivery type guys coming in and out so I will need to find some Lysol spray. 


The city I’m moving to has grocery delivery so I plan on taking full advantage of that. I also have a ton of stuff that will be delivered just after I get there.

1556,"If you haven’t done so already, abandon all hope and engage your “war” mindset NOW","If you haven’t done so already, abandon all hope and engage your “war” mindset NOW.

Absent a vaccine or herd immunity, there is no hope. And if you really want to vanquish all hope, consider the possibility that immunity doesn’t last long enough to make a difference, and/or  the virus mutates and renders vaccines an impossibility. 

The whole “reopen” thing, while necessary for economic reasons, led people to believe that the threat was gone and we were “back to normal.” Almost like a hurricane passed and the sun was now out. The phrase “post-COVID” world was coined. 

Pardon my language, but all of that was complete and utter horseshit. We knew what COVID would do with zero social distancing, masks, etc. We knew that nothing had changed with the virus. But yet somehow we thought the threat was gone and we could “go back to normal” and “reopen” and not pay a terrible price. 

It would be like storing 100lbs of flour in a shed, mice getting it in and ruining it, throwing out the bag, saying to yourself “well the mice are gone!”, and storing the flour in your shed again. Same thing would happen again and you’re a fool if you think otherwise. 

Go ahead and get in the mindset that this is permanent. Detach. View life as an illusion. Get used to the idea that people you know are going to die. Resist any tendencies to long for the pre-COVID world. Stop with the crazy ideas like “we’ll just have to see what it’s like when school starts back up.” Or “it’ll be gone by Thanksgiving or Christmas.” It’s not going to be, so stop deluding yourself and imploding mentally when your fairy tale goals don’t pan out. 

I say all of this bc you will have to maintain your sanity through what’s ahead. It’s going to be difficult and different, but the quicker you adapt a “hard ass” mindset the better off you will be. 

A good friend of mine committed suicide early on due to PTSD. I got really sad for a day. Started to lose hope and go into the paralysis mindset. I caught myself quickly and said “this is just the first of many, get used to it.”

You’re going to have to do likewise to be able to get through this without losing it. All the prepping in the world won’t matter if you can’t keep it together in your mind. If you go where I started to go and someone tries to rob you during that time, you’re dead. And your family. 

If there’s a miracle cure one day, great. You can always turn off the “war” mindset.

1561,Winter is Coming - how to prepare,"This is more general winter preparedness, but I’m posting it here because the goal of these preps is to minimize how often you need to leave your house, save money due to seasonal (and now pandemic induced) price increases, and prevent service calls to your house.

1. You have all these cans, but do you have a can opener? Those things break so easily. Make sure you have two on hand - one electric and one manual, or two manual.

2. You don’t want to be stuck going to the store in the middle of whatever winter brings because you need ice melt. Make sure you have enough for at least the first storm. 

3. Seasonal depression is very common, and we are already  slamming into a mental health crisis. Educate yourself on the symptoms of seasonal affective disorder. Come up with a mental health crisis plan that includes your “red flag” symptoms and what your plan is if depression hits you. Even if you doubt you’ll be impacted, it’s still good to know how to make a crisis plan in case you need to help someone through it.

4. The shrink film that goes on your windows is $5 less per box in the summer than it is in the winter - expect the price increase to be more this year, as we’ve seen with other seasonal goods.

5. Think about light blocking curtains, window caulking, door sweeps, and other insulating/energy efficient items.

6. Check your thermostat, make sure it works properly.

7. If you have an oil tank, fill it now and keep it topped off while prices are reasonable. Prices always go up in the winter, but there will be higher demand as more people stay home more often. There could also be delays in delivery depending on how the pandemic and flu season impact staffing.

8. Space heaters are going to be their cheapest around this time of year. The oil filled radiator style is blessedly efficient and safer for pets and small children than coil heaters. Space heaters can either be used as a backup or can help reduce oil use which will make your oil tank last longer.

9. Do you have kids? They always seem to shoot up a size between now and October. Clothing prices have gone down, so now is the time to get what you need. Don’t forget shoes, socks, and outerwear!

10. How are your clothes fitting? Some of us lost, some of us gained, we all need clothes that fit. I don’t care what size you were, you are the size you are now. Just get something that fits. Especially if it’s a bra.

11. Expect food storage items to continue increasing in price over the next several months. Now is a good time to organize your pantry and assess not only what food you may need, but what you need to store it all.

12. Have you checked the insulation on your pipes? Do you have a plan on what to do if the heat goes out so you don’t get a burst pipe and need several service people in your home? (Hint: part of your plan should be to put the faucet on a fast drip to help keep the water moving and prevent a full freeze and burst pipes)

13. Do you want to invest in any cooking items? They will probably be a hot gift item this fall since people are doing more home cooking. If there is something you need like mixing bowls or a knife that doesn’t suck, now is the time to get that.

14. Mice are going to be all over our nice warm houses and stocked pantries once it gets cold. Start looking for entry points around your house and block them with steel wool. Make sure your food storage isn’t just ziplock bags they can get to in one chomp.

15. Do you have antifreeze and a window scraper for your car? Climate change is doing some weird stuff and people further south are seeing snow. It’s good to have on hand.

16. Speaking of cars, how are your tires? When was the last time you had your oil changed? How about the spark plugs and battery?

17. Remember that masks are 1000x more comfortable once fall hits. Do you have enough of those? 1 layer of cotton and a 1 layer of cotton flannel is too hot for most people in the summer, but will be both comfortable and more effective come fall and winter, especially with a layer of interfacing.

18. Tylenol, Motrin, etc are all important too but are being covered in so many other posts, but do make sure you have batteries for your thermometers. If your thermometer requires those ear shields, get an extra pack.

19. Do you have smoke detectors? Carbon monoxide detectors? On every floor? When was the last time you checked the batteries? Do you have a family fire escape plan? Fire extinguisher? Fire escape ladder? Fire blanket? Do you know how to put out a grease fire? (Hint: DO NOT USE WATER. Use a fire extinguisher.)

20. Do you have an emergency kit in your car that’s appropriate for the winter? Will you be okay if your car breaks down and you have to wait a long time for help? Think flares, jumper cables, spare tire and kit (this is a good time to learn how to use it too), an emergency blanket + extra hats, socks, and mittens plus some drinking

1563,Shopping tip - Pulse Oximeters are back in stock at Walmart.com,I was a little late to the pulse oximeter party when I was looking for them online this spring. A lot of places were completely sold out or were back ordered for a really long time.

We ordered one for ourselves last week and it received it in less than a week. I ordered another one for my mom today and will be getting it on Monday. I just wanted to give everyone a heads up in case you have been looking for one - I have a feeling they might get hard to find here again with the increase in cases (just like masks and gloves are getting hard to find again for medical providers).

1564,Can we talk about the best (non-N95) masks to stockpile for fall/winter?,"Obviously most of us would like to have a stockpile of N95s or respirators to use into the fall/winter, but that's unfortunately not practical (too bad some of that $1200 stimulus in the US didn't go into sending everyone a few boxes of them). I know that virtually any kind of decent mask will help with reducing the spread of germs, but I'm trying to also protect myself while protecting others. Can we come to a consensus on the best N95 alternative?

It seems to me that the options are:
1) KN95s of various origin/quality - can they really be trusted? Are they the next best thing?
2) High quality fabric masks with disposable filter inserts - Vistaprint, ShopVida, etc. - the question here is whether or not the filter inserts are truly N95 and whether you'll actually breathe through vs. around that filter.
3) High quality fabric masks without disposable filters - without some kind of good insert, will they really help with aerosolized particles?
4) Surgical-type masks - to me this is the bare minimum, but isn't going to really protect the wearer.

Other options?

So how and when do you say, ""Okay, I'm done. I have everything I need?"" Because I just want to be done with it now. Everyone with a website has a list of ""Essentials"" for preppers and I check those sites as a resource in case I forget something important, but I also start to feel overwhelmed with ALL the essentials I will apparently ""need.""

1579,Need to wear nitirile gloves all day- will I suffer long-term consequences from wrinkled hands or corn starch application?,"Hello,
I live in a hotspot in a household with people who don't take more than the legally mandated precautions and invite friends over and go out, etc. I'm working on moving out ASAP but for the time being I am rotating N95 masks and don't leave my room without wearing one (with a cloth mask on top to limit exposure to the N95).

I've also taken to wearing 12"" 8mm nitrile gloves all day, because the constant soap and alcohol was giving me rashes. I'm aware of the advice not to wear gloves, but I have not once touched my face with them and probably wash them more frequently than I would wash my bare hands.

I'm using corn starch as a dessicant, but my hands still are very wrinkled by the end of the day. Could this be detrimental for my long term health?

It's nice to not need to change them but I will invest in 4mm gloves if this is a problem. So far my hands seem normal the next morning.

Also I am under the assumption that I am avoiding cross contamination with my constant application of 80% ethanol, but please let me know if you think that disposal is vastly superior to sterilization in my case.

1590,Help! First dry canning attempt big failure!,"So I buy a huge amount of lentils from local Indian grocery store, come home, watched a few YouTube tutorials on how to dry can beans etc. I *swear* I followed everything to the T. Got them out , left for awhile, went to check after all had popped. There was CONDENSATION inside every one of them!

So I quickly got as many bowls as possible to get them all out to dry before they got ruined. I dropped quite a bit on the floor and pretty much everywhere, in a panic. The lentils seem to be ok this morning-no clumping or anything. BUT! When I went to sweep the floor, I saw 2 live maggots! 

I’m sickened and scared to death to consume these now! When I run my hands through them, I see no bugs, but obviously there are some! 

I’m thinking I had to not have left the jars in the oven long enough to dry after washing? Or possibly the lids...

The main reason I wanted to oven can *was* to kill any bugs!

Please no lectures on how you’re not supposed to dry can, cause I *really* want these bugs DEAD. 

I live in a pretty humid place, not sure if that’s it. 

So my questions: any ideas on what I did wrong? Can I freeze them to kill anything? Don’t have much room in freezer at all though, and I bought 40# cause I eat them often. Would they be safe now to vacuum seal them with my food saver in jars? This scares me though since I saw 2 disgusting live maggots squirming on the floor!

2. Have a plan. Write out your evacuation plan, have a backup place for the family to meet in case you get separated. 

3. Have copies of family photos and important documents at a trusted family members home.  If you’re comfortable back up your family photos online. 

4. Get out when you are told to leave. Pack your things if fire is anywhere near by. Be ready to go.

1608,What is the creative ways for invitation to Wedding in the pandemic?,"Here is what I know: 

1) Brother in law invited us to wedding. 

2) He and his new fiance are strong Republicans from rural Midwest farm areas, but I know that general audiences are hard core Trump supporters that often post mask such a hoax in their facebook, and all this pandemic is just jokes and too political. 

3) The wedding will be held in a county, where mask mandate is required for social gathering and per the county's public health department, the enforcement should occur. 

4) The positivity rate is around less than 1%, so I think the chance is low, but given surprising contagious R0 for COVID 19, no body is guaranteed. 

Honestly, if we can, we don't really want to visit, but I think that is not realistic options. I wished that he didn't have to do wedding this fall, but I also think that there is no guarantee that they can host wedding next year either. 

We are willing to take off masks just for photos ops, and dining, but throughout the overall wedding, we would like to wear masks for our safety although I admit that just wearing mask is not helpful either. 

So realistically what is the best way to get out of this conundrum? 

I thought about becoming primary contact in 2 days before so I can self quarantine as well as my wife, in which case, we are required to not visit the wedding, but while that is in plan, I wanted to see some suggestions here in Reddit.

1610,Son’s teacher tested positive for COVID. Help me prepare for what’s ahead!!!,"My 4 year old son is back at daycare (my husband and I are essential workers). Today, we were notified that one of his teachers took a covid test on Friday, after being notified that she was a direct contact with another positive person.  She didn’t have symptoms, but on Sunday, her test came back as positive. 

Today, after watching surveillance footage, they confirmed that my son is a direct contact, defined as being in close proximity for 15 or more minutes. 

I am FREAKING THE F*$&amp; OUT. I’m now trying to wrap my head around the fact that we may all get this, and be on our own to deal with it. How do I prepare? I have two sons, 4 and 12, and my husband and I are both 39. So, I’m trying to get my whole house ready to be very sick for a long time. 

I need any suggestions you have. Toys, meals, other supplies, ANYTHING. I’ve felt pretty prepared for this, but now that it’s upon me, I don’t really know what to do. HELP!!!

1611,Covid scare - sign of whats to come?,"Long story short....I have some of the symptoms of covid.  I tested negative, but still have something modest I am dealing with. 

The thing that became clear was the clinic I normally go to - was overwhelmed, with start of cold and flu season patients, kids, parents, and people wanting evaluations, help, or the covid test.  I could not get through phone lines for 6 hours - finally having to go in person to ask to be scheduled a covid test (you are supposed to call to schedule not show up).  This place is known in the community for having the rapid (15 mins) test so they dont have to wait 1-3 days like other places nearby.

 I think this is what some of the experts have said will happen throughout the fall/winter - people getting sick -not knowing if they got covid or just bad cold/flu - running to clinics and medical offices and hospitals for tests and treatments- doctors and nurses overwhelmed. Even in any normal year the flu and colds can lead to nasty bronchitis or pneumonia in many folks - requiring drugs to clear up difficult breathing or fevers - happened to me in the past for sure. Some schools are allowing in person or hybrid child attendance... and sick kids may not show up to school unless tested

1629,I'm sick with something else and I need to relocate to find medical treatment. Please help me figure out a plan!," I am 27. I'm weak/underweight and sick from severe heartburn. I need to     have diagnostic tests done including an endoscopy. I live with my     narcissistic/abusive mother in central New Jersey. She will not allow me to live   in her home if I seek medical treatment that I need during covid times. So, I need to move out.

I spend the little energy that I have doing remote work. I make roughly 6k/month and so I figure I can afford roughly 2k in rent. At some point next year (after covid), I'd likely have to  come into the office (Palo Alto, CA).

Anyway, I think I have the financial means to move out but I don't know where   to go now  and I  am afraid of completely living on my own  while being   weak/sick.  I have no drivers license, and I walk with a limp  because  of  an  orthopedic issue that I have with my ankle (which also needs a treatment, but I'll deal with that later).   


I am deathly afraid of corona because it seems like my immune system is already working hard to deal with the stomach disease that I have. My stomach disease may be of bacterial origin, but I won't know until get the tests done after I move out.

1634,"As we head into the winter, what’s your takeaway from the first lockdown?","I’m based in Spain and our lockdown in the spring was one of the most restrictive (some say draconian but that has a negative connotation and I think it was pretty effective while it lasted). After a summer where most people acted like covid didn’t exist, we’re barreling into our second wave and I’m just trying to reflect on what I can do to prepare. 

While the curve was flat and cases were low I took advantage and went to the dentist, got doctors appointments out of the way, bought an exercise bike, recorded an album, and started a bunch of home improvement projects that can be continued once the country locks down again and I started my winter garden. However, my assumption is that this confinement will extend until the spring so we’re talking at least 6 months. 

I guess my question is, what did we learn from the the first lockdown? What if anything are you doing differently going into the winter? 

My big takeaways were mostly that grocery delivery was tricky to secure but ultimately safe and available, while  getting raw materials for projects, crafts, gardening was more complicated. I happily didn’t cross my doorstep for 8 weeks even though I was legally allowed to... not seeing anyone was fine by me but having a project to work on (setting up a garden, writing music) helped give me a purpose. 

I’ve never spent the holidays away from my family (they live in the US) so maybe prep with some Xmas decor and festive food? Buy some fabric and yarn so if inspired I can start making masks or sweaters? Invest in more exciting winter loungewear since we know we won’t be leaving the house?

1637,Organizing food preps into 1-3 month grab-n-go containers.

This year food preps increased quite a bit and now things need more organization and to be mobile for a grab-n-go scenario. If we have to evacuate, and have the time, the preps are coming with!

What I’m thinking is to have each storage tote with 1-3 months worth of food for 4 (3 meals/day). This would be all the basics- flour, rice, seasoning, canned goods, dried legumes/beans/veggies, etc. If each tote held 1 month then I could look and easily count off exact how many months of food er have on hand. 

What I could use some guidance on is determining how much food would be needed. Ex: I found a resource that said 3 cups of flour = 1 lb  = 1 loaf of bread. Most people consume 1 loaf/ week. So I would need 12 cups/ month for 4 loaves.

ANy tips on what I should do to prepare for when he comes home? We live in a tiny appartment.

Obviously I'll be sleeping in the living room/kitchen, while he can sleep and WFH from the bedroom. But I'm sure I'll forget to prepare things.

I was thinking :

- Setting a stack of my clothes in the living room, so I don't have to wander in the bedroom, maybe in a suitcase

- Alloting him one place in the living room, where he can sit to watch tv, and eat.

- Cleaning plates, and cutlery on high temps in the dishwasher (although fomites aren't such a big transmission source, apparently)

- washing my hands frequently, wearing a mask when in the same room

- airing the room several times a day

- cleaning the toilet after each use (wipes for the seat, and a splash of chlorox in the toilet)

- turmeric

- Echinacea

- birch

- [poplars](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populus)

- Liquorice

- Boswellia 

- Commiphora 

They recommend to stop taking them, if you're taking them preventively, as soon as you're experiencing the first symptoms of covid, and to call your doctor and discuss which treatment you can continue if they were prescribed.

It's not piercing pain as you might expect from appendicitis, just mild to low achey pain.

I tried calling a gastroenterologist and they said they are full up until end of December and require a PCP to sign-off to see them.

They did nothing other than run a bunch of tests and say I was fine.

1678,The Coronavirus Is Airborne Indoors. Why Are We Still Scrubbing Surfaces?,"# The Coronavirus Is Airborne Indoors. Why Are We Still Scrubbing Surfaces?

Scientists who initially warned about contaminated surfaces now say that the virus spreads primarily through inhaled droplets, and that there is little to no evidence that deep cleaning mitigates the threat indoors.

HONG KONG — At Hong Kong’s deserted airport, cleaning crews constantly spray baggage trolleys, elevator buttons and check-in counters with antimicrobial solutions. In New York City, workers continually disinfect surfaces on buses and subways. In London, many pubs spent lots of money on intensive surface cleaning to reopen after lockdown — before closing again in November.

All over the world, workers are soaping, wiping and fumigating surfaces with an urgent sense of purpose: to fight the coronavirus. But scientists increasingly say that there is little to no evidence that contaminated surfaces can spread the virus. In crowded indoor spaces like airports, they say, the virus that is exhaled by infected people and that lingers in the air is a much greater threat.

Hand washing with soap and water for 20 seconds — or sanitizer in the absence of soap — is still encouraged to stop the virus’s spread. But scrubbing surfaces does little to mitigate the virus threat indoors, experts say, and health officials are being urged to focus instead on improving ventilation and filtration of indoor air

“In my opinion, a lot of time, energy and money is being wasted on surface disinfection and, more importantly, diverting attention and resources away from preventing airborne transmission,” said Dr. Kevin P. Fennelly, a respiratory infection specialist with the United States National Institutes of Health.

Some experts suggest that Hong Kong, a crowded city of 7.5 million residents and a long history of infectious disease outbreaks, is a case study for the kind of operatic surface cleaning that gives ordinary people a false sense of security about the coronavirus.

The Hong Kong Airport Authority has used a phone-booth-like “full-body disinfection channel” to spritz airport staff members in quarantine areas. The booth — which the airport says is the first in the world and is being used in trials only on its staff — is part of an all-out effort to make the facility a “safe environment for all users.

Such displays can be comforting to the public because they seem to show that local officials are taking the fight to Covid-19. But Shelly Miller, an expert on aerosols at the University of Colorado Boulder, said that the booth made no practical sense from an infection-control standpoint.

Viruses are emitted through activities that spray respiratory droplets — talking, breathing, yelling, coughing, singing and sneezing. And disinfecting sprays are often made from toxic chemicals that can significantly affect indoor air quality and human health, Dr. Miller said.

“I can’t understand why anyone would think that disinfecting a whole person would reduce the risk of transmitting virus,” she said.

A range of respiratory ailments, including the common cold and influenza, are caused by germs that can spread from contaminated surfaces. So when the coronavirus outbreak emerged last winter in the Chinese mainland, it seemed logical to assume that these so-called fomites were a primary means for the pathogen to spread.

Studies soon found that the virus seemed to survive on some surfaces, including plastic and steel, for up to three days. (Studies later showed that much of this is likely to be dead fragments of the virus that are not infectious.) The World Health Organization also emphasized surface transmission as a risk, and said that airborne spread was a concern only when health care workers were engaged in certain medical procedures that produce aerosols.

But scientific evidence was growing that the virus could stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in stagnant air, infecting people as they inhaled — particularly in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation.

In July, an essay in The Lancet medical journal argued that some scientists had exaggerated the risk of coronavirus infection from surfaces without considering evidence from studies of its closely related cousins, including SARS-CoV, the driver of the 2002-03 SARS epidemic.

“This is extremely strong evidence that at least for the original SARS virus, fomite transmission was very minor at most,” the essay’s author, the microbiologist Emanuel Goldman of Rutgers University, said in an email. “There is no reason to expect that the close relative SARS-CoV-2 would behave significantly different in this kind of experiment,” he added, referring to the new coronavirus.

A few days after Dr. Goldman’s Lancet essay appeared, more than 200 scientists called on the W.H.O. to acknowledge that the coronavirus could spread by air in any indoor setting. Bowing to enormous public pressure over the issue, the agency acknowledged that indoor aerosol transmission could lead to outbreaks in poorly ventilated indoor places like restaurants, nightclubs, offices and places of worship.

By October, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which had maintained since May that surfaces are “not the primary way the virus spreads,” was saying that transmission of infectious respiratory droplets was the “principal mode” through which it does.

But by then, paranoia about touching anything from handrails to grocery bags had taken off. And the instinct to scrub surfaces as a Covid precaution — “hygiene theater,” as The Atlantic magazine called it — was already deeply ingrained.

“My tennis partner and I have abandoned shaking hands at the end of a match — but, since I’ve touched the tennis balls that he has touched, what’s the point?” Geoff Dyer wrote in a March essay for The New Yorker magazine that captured the germaphobic zeitgeist.

From Nairobi to Milan to Seoul, cleaners in hazmat suits have been fumigating public areas despite W.H.O. warnings that the chemicals could do more harm than good.

In Hong Kong, where 299 people died during the original SARS epidemic, elevator buttons are often covered in plastic that is cleaned multiple times a day. Crews in some office buildings and subways wipe escalator handrails with disinfected rags as commuters ascend. Cleaners have blasted public places with antimicrobial coatings and added a fleet of robots to clean surfaces in subway cars.

Several Hong Kong-based scientists insist the deep cleaning can’t hurt, and supported the government’s strict social-distancing rules and its monthslong insistence on near-universal mask wearing.

Procter &amp; Gamble said sales of its personal cleansing products grew more than 30 percent in the quarter that ended in September, with double-digit growth in every region of the world, including more than 20 percent in greater China.

Early on, officials required Hong Kong restaurants to install dividers between tables — the same sort of flimsy, and essentially useless, protection used at the U.S. vice-presidential debate in October.

But as the Hong Kong authorities have gradually eased restrictions on indoor gatherings, including allowing wedding parties of up to 50 people, there is a fear of potentially new outbreaks indoors.

Some experts say they are especially concerned that coronavirus droplets could spread through air vents in offices, which are crowded because the city has not yet developed a robust culture of remote work.

“People are removing masks for lunch or when they get back to their cubicle because they assume their cubicle is their private space,” said Yeung King-lun, a professor of chemical and biological engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

“But remember: The air you’re breathing in is basically communal.”

1679,How and when do you use your preps ?,"During the first wave (okay first lock-downs) in our state - the grocery stores where still open. I was not a fully prepped as I am now - but I had some preps.   My family is all work from home and learn remote. My only reason for leaving the house last April/May was to go to the drive through Walgreens for prescriptions or to the grocery store for some basic foods. I really tried to limit my trips to grocery but I was not as prepped as I am now. My state returned to lock-down yesterday.  

So with cases skyrocketing and the lock downs starting here, and sporadic shortages of things like TP showing up  - I am beginning to draw on my preps. My goal is maybe go to the grocery store every two weeks for fresh veggies and fruit or little things. That's maybe 20 mins in the store and I will have full PPE when I go.

So how do you plan to use your preps as we hit these new covid spikes or lockdowns?  Lock the door and stay home until March ? Little limited runs to the grocery store like me for a few things ? Delivery only of food ? keep going to grocery store and not  use your preps unless there is real SHTF shortages ? or some other approach ?",PandemicPreps,1605950045,ThisIsAbuse,120,1,True,2020-11-21 01:14:05,first wave okay first lock downs state grocery stores still open fully prepped preps family work home learn remote reason leaving house last april may go drive walgreens prescriptions grocery store basic foods really tried limit trips grocery prepped state returned lock yesterday cases skyrocketing lock downs starting sporadic shortages things like tp showing beginning draw preps goal maybe go grocery store every two weeks fresh veggies fruit little things maybe mins store full ppe go plan use preps hit new covid spikes lockdowns lock door stay home march little limited runs grocery store like things delivery food keep going grocery store use preps unless real shtf shortages approach,first wave okay first lock down state groceri store still open fulli prep prep famili work home learn remot reason leav hous last april may go drive walgreen prescript groceri store basic food realli tri limit trip groceri prep state return lock yesterday case skyrocket lock down start sporad shortag thing like tp show begin draw prep goal mayb go groceri store everi two week fresh veggi fruit littl thing mayb min store full ppe go plan use prep hit new covid spike lockdown lock door stay home march littl limit run groceri store like thing deliveri food keep go groceri store use prep unless real shtf shortag approach
1680,Prepping for getting sick- creating an isolation area in your home,"I posted this in r/prepperintel , and someone there suggested putting here. This is how I prepped for getting sick. 

Luckily I never did get sick, but we were ready if one of us got covid19 

Back in May when I was initially forced back into the workplace I set up an area in our home which would serve as isolation/quarantine if I (or anyone) got the virus. For us, it was a guest bedroom with a small adjacent bathroom. We don’t have small children, so things are much easier for us. We do have pets, and would never want to expose them. 

First,  I bought one of those plastic sheet construction zipper “doors” and painters tape. The idea is to tape it up over the bedroom door, and the sick person would be basically walled off from the rest of the house-the non-sick person would only open the zipper door to slide food and drink through. I also had a scrub brush and dish soap set aside in the bathroom, so I could wash my own dishes too. Had not worked out leftover food disposal yet.

Then I put together a medical box: theraflu, DayQuil, acetaminophen, ox-meter, thermometer, Dramamine, my allergy meds, vitamins c, d, some of those airborne packets, zinc lozenges, melatonin. Added tissue and aloe. 

Then a disinfectant bucket, with Clorox clean up, Lysol spray, disinfecting wipes and rags- which I have now replaced with paper towel. Hand soap was refilled in the bathroom, and I added several bars of ivory soap. I made sure there was 14 days of TP in there too. 

I added 2 small trash pails. One for dirty disinfecting materials, one for puke- if needed. I also had a humidifier in the room and a tower fan. I had some clean wash cloths in the room t wet with cold water in case I got a fever.

I had read early on that the virus was likely transmitted in the air, so I was prepared to cover the vents in the room with plastic and painters tape, so that the air I was breathing would not transfer back through the house. Our guest room has a large window and a door to the back yard, so I could get fresh air. 

Finally I threw my old lap top, extra phone charging cable, chargers and some books in the room, along with several changes of pajamas. 

Because our guest room has a bathroom, I already had a toothbrush, soap, hairbrush, soap in there, but these things should be in your isolation unit too. 

Just something to think about prepping, especially if you are in a job where you my be exposed. You may not have a solution as convenient as mine, but the more you can limit your activities to an isolated room, from the moment you find out you are infected, the more you could theoretically keep others safe.",PandemicPreps,1606013458,MinaFur,50,1,True,2020-11-21 18:50:58,posted r prepperintel someone suggested putting prepped getting sick never get sick ready one us got covid may initially forced back workplace set area home would serve isolation quarantine anyone got virus us guest bedroom small adjacent bathroom small children things much easier us pets would never want expose bought one plastic sheet construction zipper doors painters tape idea tape bedroom door sick person would basically walled rest house non sick person would open zipper door slide food drink also scrub brush dish soap set aside bathroom could wash dishes worked leftover food disposal yet put together medical box theraflu dayquil acetaminophen ox meter thermometer dramamine allergy meds vitamins c airborne packets zinc lozenges melatonin added tissue aloe disinfectant bucket clorox clean lysol spray disinfecting wipes rags replaced paper towel hand soap refilled bathroom added several bars ivory soap made sure days tp added small trash pails one dirty disinfecting materials one puke needed also humidifier room tower fan clean wash cloths room wet cold water case got fever read early virus likely transmitted air prepared cover vents room plastic painters tape air breathing would transfer back house guest room large window door back yard could get fresh air threw old lap top extra phone charging cable chargers books room along several changes pajamas guest room bathroom already toothbrush soap hairbrush soap things isolation unit something think prepping especially job exposed may solution convenient mine limit activities isolated room moment find infected could theoretically keep others safe,post r prepperintel someon suggest put prep get sick never get sick readi one us got covid may initi forc back workplac set area home would serv isol quarantin anyon got viru us guest bedroom small adjac bathroom small children thing much easier us pet would never want expos bought one plastic sheet construct zipper door painter tape idea tape bedroom door sick person would basic wall rest hous non sick person would open zipper door slide food drink also scrub brush dish soap set asid bathroom could wash dish work leftov food dispos yet put togeth medic box theraflu dayquil acetaminophen ox meter thermomet dramamin allergi med vitamin c airborn packet zinc lozeng melatonin ad tissu alo disinfect bucket clorox clean lysol spray disinfect wipe rag replac paper towel hand soap refil bathroom ad sever bar ivori soap made sure day tp ad small trash pail one dirti disinfect materi one puke need also humidifi room tower fan clean wash cloth room wet cold water case got fever read earli viru like transmit air prepar cover vent room plastic painter tape air breath would transfer back hous guest room larg window door back yard could get fresh air threw old lap top extra phone charg cabl charger book room along sever chang pajama guest room bathroom alreadi toothbrush soap hairbrush soap thing isol unit someth think prep especi job expos may solut conveni mine limit activ isol room moment find infect could theoret keep other safe

1682,Neutral Detergent for Cleaning 3M Half Facepiece Respirators,"Hi, 

The official documentations from 3M recommended using mild and neutral detergent for cleaning 3M Half Facepiece Respirators prior to disinfecting them.

&gt; Add neutral detergent if necessary. Do not use cleaners containing lanolin or other oils.

[https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/473937O/3mtm-cleaning-reusable-respirators.pdf](https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/473937O/3mtm-cleaning-reusable-respirators.pdf)

I believe neutral means a detergent that has a pH of 7 while mild means no added oils or other additives.

I've been using Cetaphil to remove face grease from the reusable respirator but it is costly.

Does anyone have any recommendations for a mild and neutral detergent/soap with simple ingredients that is also cost effective?

1685,Reminder to vaccinate yourself/pets/livestock.,"I highly recommend getting updated on the flu vaccine and any other vaccines for yourself.  HPV vaccine can prevent many types of cancer.  If you've had chickenpox, ask your doctor when you should get the shingles vaccine.  If you regularly interact with wild animals, ask your doc if you should get the rabies vaccine.  You never know what might happen in the future with availability, so do it soon.  Some grocery stores will give you a discount on a single grocery trip if you get the flu shot there.  

Also, ask your vet what vaccines your pets or livestock should get and be sure to remain up to date on antiparasitics (flea/tick/etc.).  Thankfully most infections are species specific, but you don't want to be patient zero if it jumps species, which is why it is important to make sure the animals that live with us stay healthy.  I was reading about RHDV2 in rabbits which is why I made this post.

1693,"What do I need in case of a power shortage, as a city dweller in a tiny appartment with no chimney ?","In France we've had warning that they may be power shortages in february 2021 due to a lot of our nuclear plants that are planned to go on maintenance (some were planned during 2020 and got postponed because of the pandemic).

If this really happens this means I'll be without heating and electricity. Main door to the building won't be locked. Maybe issues with tap water ? 

So far I have: 

- 4 small flat solar garden lights that store light on the windowsill during the day to release it at night

- candles and decent candle holders (meaning fairly high), lighters and matches

- bubble wrap to set on all my windows (for insulation)

- a few foil survival blankets, that we could set on the windows to keep the heat in. (and use as blankets obviously)

- an apparatus to warm the room with 2 pots overs a candle

- a tiny fondue set with a little stock of lighting gel to keep it going, migh also work with the small ikea candles in aluminium pans

- a small flashlight

- lots of warm clothes, thermal socks, warm blankets. Considering moving the mattress under the table and build a tent of blankets if things get bad.

I don't have a solar panel. Not sure what to get. Ideally, so hubby could stay safely at home, we'd need something to get his laptop going, and charge the cell phones. I'm open to any advice on this matter. I should be portable and discreet.

Do you ever refund your customers, or do you just fob them off until they give up. 


I ordered 2 of your masks as part of wave 14, they arrived when you said they would. This would be perfect except for the fact that they were for my Grandad, who's health had gone rapidly downhill and he went into a hospice. 


I returned the masks unopened. On the 4th of September. I sent follow up emails. You told me I'd get the refund but you're very busy. I can understand, there's a pandemic on and you make a very useful product. 5th of November I thought, it's been 2 months, I'll give them a call. I was told I'd get a confirmation email, I didn't. I was told I'd get my refund within 14 working days. I haven't. 


I can understand that you're probably short staffed and overworked. I work in oncology for the NHS, so trust me I get that. But I really do feel that over 3 months for a £50 refund is really poor customer service. Please sort it out. 

(I posted this on Instagram last Saturday)

1707,Stock up on things shipped on dry ice?,"With all the talk of scrambling to get dry ice for vaccine shipments, I wonder if there will be a shortage for other things that require dry ice?

My personal example is one of my dog's foods. It is frozen raw food that is shipped on dry ice. I used to buy direct, but they began requiring a large order, so I was travelling to a store to get it one bag at a time. Either way, it's still shipped to the pet stores on dry ice (I inquired at 2 stores anyway). 

If they start pulling dry ice from vendors as a priority thing, I'm concerned the raw pet food supply chain might get tangled for a while. OR I have no idea how things work and there is absolutely no reason to be concerned.

Anyway, I thought I'd throw that notion out there. As soon as budget permits I am going to place a direct order and just ""bite the bullet"" to spend for a larger order.

1715,ORBITGear W210-A VX Mask Warning!,"I was looking for some new reusable masks to add to my lineup, and came across the W210-A from ORBITGear as seemingly a solid option from reviews on other subreddits and platforms. 

A bit longer shipping time than I would have preferred, but my three masks (from the most recent batch) arrived and my first impression was positive until I went to test the filter section. I discovered that there was absolutely NO ability for air to pass through the mask, and not in the sense that ""it was just hard to breathe"" like some people say when wearing an N95, but if you cover up all the gaps around the mask, you would actually suffocate. 

Asked around on reddit, and while I got some responses from others (none that got masks from the same batch as mine) saying that although the masks weren't super breathable, they at least worked. Gave one a thorough wash to make sure it didn't need to be ""broken in?"" to no avail. 

Contacted custom service and got a very quick response explaining that breathability was not the strong suit of their mask and they were working on fixing it in an upcoming revision. They also said they would refund my entire order in 5 days. Provided my order number and other relevant details but haven't heard anything since, will reach back out on the 5th day if no refund has been received. 

Overall, considering ALL THREE of my masks would be no more effective than going maskless if worn, I obviously can't recommend this product. Maybe this is just a defect of the masks in my batch, which would explain the positive sentiment towards the mask from others, but I still don't think it's a smart purchase, especially since while the customer service has seemed great, I don't want to make a judgment until they have ACTUALLY refunded me. Will comment with an update when this happens/doesn't happen.

1716,Improved mask effectiveness,"For the past 2 months, we have been using a ""mask brace"" product from a company called Fix the Mask.  The biggest failure point of regular masks is the air gaps around the sides.  High risk medical professionals have their N 95's fitted for that reason.  No matter how good the filtration is on the masks that we can get a hold of, the filtration is zero for air going in and out of gaps between our skin and th emask.  This mask brace was designed to help that problem.  I don't have any affiliation with this small company other than that I have purchased their product for all of our family members.   The A good recent link for a summary of their findings is [https://fixthemask.medium.com/surgical-mask-data-a3f49ea66107](https://fixthemask.medium.com/surgical-mask-data-a3f49ea66107)

Their design, research and development has been extensive.  I even tried their original idea using rubber bands and also their free prototype pattern to cut the first generation shape out of sheet latex.  This developed version is much better.  A huge fail on mask in real life use is peripheral fit and the resulting two way air leakage.  

 I won't kid you, there is definitely a learning curve to using them.  I am impressed.  They do exactly what they are designed to do.  They even reduced glasses fogging for my husband.  I have decades of experience wearing different types/levels of masks at work and this mask &amp; brace combination is not as uncomfortable as wearing some masks I have used.... nor is it as uncomfortable as wearing a military gas mask, I can tell you that !  :)   The brace is made from a high grade silicone, so material sensitivity should not be an issue. Wash with soap and water to sanitize and let air dry.  One or two per person should last for a long time, in my estimation.  Consider checking it out at [fixthemask.com](https://fixthemask.com).  Would be helpful for smoke, too.  While I have used it with rectangular masks usually, a family member uses it with cone shaped KN95's.

1717,Several more low-cost and free preventive measures,"I’m very thankful to this sub, because I got great tips here back in early spring 2020.  I wanted to share a few things that we are doing at my house to prevent infection.  This is along the lines of the posts in which people ask, ""Why aren’t more people wearing goggles?"" but with several more ideas like that.

To those of us who have spent hundreds of hours reading up on the virus (especially those who are well-prepared), I'm sure some of what I list below may seem like common sense.  And yet I don’t know anyone in real life who does these things.  I mean, my neighbors throw parties every weekend.  So I thought this could be worth a post, even if this isn't the exact right sub for it.  The problem is, posting it anywhere else - they'd probalby shout it down and say it is based on paranoia rather than a cautious risk assessment and acknowledgment of the fact that there are still a lot of unknowns about this virus and what its long-term health implications are.  

My methods are more extreme than anyone I know in real life because A) I’m at a high-risk of complications from COVID due to pre-existing health conditions, and B) I firmly believe COVID is a whole lot more serious than most people seem to think it is.  So, I don’t plan to ease up on these restrictions until a few months after the US population is 75% vaccinated (if that day ever comes, which seems remote at this point).  A few of our methods:

1. **Outdoor Trash for Mail**.  We keep an exterior trash can outside.  That’s the place for checking mail, discarding exterior envelopes and packaging.  For anything that gets shipped to our house, the exterior box or package doesn’t come inside at any point.

2. **Crew cut or shaved heads – for men and women too.**  I saw photos of South Korean nurses gearing up for COVID in an emergency room back in March 2020, and noted that they were shaving their sideburns and sides of their heads down to the skin, before putting on a protective plastic hair covering.  (Unlike the US, that country had proper PPE for its nurses.)  This may be a theory but it seems like common sense to me that long hair acts as a virus “catcher,” grabbing virus particles out of the air and helping you bring them home with you.  Edit:  We trim our own hair at home so having crew cuts or shaved heads is low-cost plus it doesn't expose us to the virus at a barber or hair salon.  Vanity is not a luxury we can afford during a plague. 

3. **Shave beards and facial hair, obviously.**  For one thing, they grab and retain virus.  For another, a mask can’t fit against the skin properly and form a good seal, if a beard is holding the mask up and away from the skin.

4. **Maximum/extreme social distancing.**  I never believed for a second that 6 feet of distance was enough.  Then we saw studies that the virus can travel 25 feet or more.  My rule of thumb is that if I’m close enough to smell someone’s cigarette smoke (or would be, if they were smoking) then I’m close enough to be inhaling their virus.  I avoid people like the plague, pun intended. [Edit: Since spring I've operated under the belief that any given grocery employee, dental or healthcare employee, law enforcement, mail or delivery driver, teacher, etc. (anyone who works in the public), has an extremely high chance of being a carrier and super-spreader.  At this point, a few weeks after millions of Americans traveled for Thanksgiving, I assume that any person in the US has a high chance of being a super-spreader.  That includes people who are asymptomatic and people who just got their negative COVID test result (due to the rate of false negatives and the possibility that a person got infected after their sample was taken).]

5. **Goggles.** 'Nuff said.

6. **Food Safety.**  I know there are people who will disagree with this on the basis of a supposed lack of evidence, but we stopped eating any foods prepared outside of our home, months ago.  I don't foresee anyone testing what happens when someone touches a hamburger bun with contaminated hands, or coughs on deep-fried food before it is served, so, I can't wait around for specific ""evidence"" of what seems like a common sense way to become infected.  For us, even if we discard the packaging and sanitize the counter and everything the box touched, the risk is too great that some teenager in the kitchen sneezed on the food after it was cooked, or touched it with dirty hands (perhaps after adjusting a virus mask).  We also avoid foods that are eaten raw with minimal washing, like lettuce or fruit that isn’t something we can peel (we avoid berries, grapes, etc.).

7.  **No visitors.**  If a person doesn’t live in my house, they don’t enter my house. They also don’t enter my yard (it’s locked and stays locked).  Packages are delivered at the street, not to my door.  

8. **Wipe-downs.**  We wipe down everything that enters our house from the outside world.

9. **Decontamination.**  Upon returning from the outside world (such as a curbside grocery pickup), I strip at the entry way, put all clothes into a disposable bag headed to the wash, and take a hot shower.  Every time.  I also wear a mask and goggles for curbside pickups, because the trunk area of my vehicle is open to the passenger area, meaning the grocery clerk is breathing the same air as me for a couple of minutes – which is a couple of minutes more than desired.  They also use inferior masks such as cloth masks which aren’t doing enough.

10. **Real masks, if ya got ‘em.**  N-95s, not knock-offs, not cloth masks or t-shirt masks or the laughably inadequate neck gaiters. [Edit:  I originally sugggested against KN95s, because the KN95 product I purchased was a piece of shit.  But see comment below by /u/mercuric512]

11. **Disposable gloves** when handling groceries and doing the wipe down before they come into the house.

12. **Quarantines** - We put things ""into quarantine"" if possible, when they enter our house.  If it's a shelf-stable good, we may place it in a special spot then literally not touch it for 30 days, or longer if it's not yet needed.  Paper, plastic, metal, we do 9 days at a minimum, longer when we can.  If we have to touch any of that before it's ""out of quarantine,"" we immediately wash hands with hot soapy water for 30 seconds.  If it's a food we need before the time period has passed, we open the exterior package and dump it into a clean household container - preferably disposing of the food package outdoors rather than in our kitchen.  

I’m sure there may be people ready to tell me that I’m going to unnecessary extremes.  To me, that’s an acceptable outcome.  I’d rather take too many precautions, and not get COVID, than take too few and end up competing for the last ICU bed.  I want to survive.  

If there’s even one person out there that gets any value out of my post, and then doesn’t catch COVID or spread it, then that’s worth any flack I’ll catch from exercising extreme

1764,"Honest question: Why are they calling it a ""vaccine"" if it does NOT prevent you from getting COVID-19 or prevent you from passing it on to others?","\*\*Tried posting this in another sub.  Immediately shouted down.  I forgot redditors don't allow non-conforming thoughts in covid subs.  Duh.  This isn't the best sub for this question but I'll give it a go because those who use this sub are among the best prepared for this pandemic...

I don't think it is widely understood that the two COVID-19 vaccines granted emergency authorization in the US are not proven to prevent you from getting or spreading COVID-19. They are not even necessarily *designed* to prevent you from getting the disease, being a carrier, or infecting others. These vaccines focused on ""symptom development,"" and if a person got the injection and later avoided serious COVID symptoms, then it was determined the vaccine had ""worked."" Is that what you think, when you hear the word ""vaccine?"" It isn't, for me.

I think the Average Joe in the US hears the word ""vaccine"" and understands that to mean ""An injection that will prevent us from getting or spreading the viral disease."" That's not what this does. That's one of the various reasons they're saying we'll still have to wear masks, social distance, and wash hands, even after vaccination.

Do other ""vaccines"" work this way? The only comparable one I've read about so far is the TB vaccine, which does not prevent the vaccinated person from acquiring TB or developing TB symptoms, but prevents ""extra TB,"" a more severe form of the illness.

If this isn't a vaccine in the sense that the word is usually used, then what is it? And why are we calling it a vaccine?

Source 1: From US CDC page updated Jan 15, 2021: ""What are the benefits of getting a COVID-19 vaccine?...A COVID-19 vaccine might prevent you from getting COVID-19. Or, if you get COVID-19, the vaccine might keep you from becoming seriously ill or from developing serious complications."" [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-vaccine/art-20484859](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-vaccine/art-20484859)

Source 2: From Forbes 12/27/20: ""Does the vaccine prevent you from being infected with the virus? So far, the published data does not seem to really answer this question. For example, a December 10 publication in the New England Journal of Medicine described how investigators measured the efficacy of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in the Phase 3 clinical trial so far. They determined how well the vaccine seemed to prevent “confirmed Covid-19,” which was defined as “the presence of at least one of the following symptoms: fever, new or increased cough, new or increased shortness of breath, chills, new or increased muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, diarrhea, or vomiting,” along with a respiratory specimen positive for SARS-CoV-2. The study also measured the vaccine’s efficacy in preventing severe Covid-19.

The reasons I think the distinction is important include isssues like: a) having COVID-19, even asymptomatically, can cause lung scarring of unknown duration, which for me seems to ensure months if not years of follow-up symptoms and care - so it is logical that a vaccinated person is still subject to having that scarring and other long-hauler symptoms, and b) people who are misinformed into thinking they can't catch the disease because of a ""vaccine"" will be more likely to get it and spread it to those of us who aren't yet able to get the vaccine because there's not enough for everyone yet.",PandemicPreps,1611108372,Brills12,127,1,True,2021-01-19 18:06:12,tried posting another sub immediately shouted forgot redditors allow non conforming thoughts covid subs duh best sub question give go use sub among best prepared pandemic think widely understood two covid vaccines granted emergency authorization us proven prevent getting spreading covid even necessarily designed prevent getting disease carrier infecting others vaccines focused symptom development person got injection later avoided serious covid symptoms determined vaccine worked think hear word vaccine think average joe us hears word vaccine understands mean injection prevent us getting spreading viral disease one various reasons saying still wear masks social distance wash hands even vaccination vaccines work way comparable one read far tb vaccine prevent vaccinated person acquiring tb developing tb symptoms prevents extra tb severe form illness vaccine sense word usually used calling vaccine us cdc page updated jan benefits getting covid vaccine covid vaccine might prevent getting covid get covid vaccine might keep becoming seriously ill developing serious complications forbes vaccine prevent infected virus far published data seem really answer question example december publication new england journal medicine described investigators measured efficacy pfizer biontech vaccine phase clinical trial far determined well vaccine seemed prevent confirmed covid defined presence least one following symptoms fever new increased cough new increased shortness breath chills new increased muscle pain new loss taste smell sore throat diarrhea vomiting along respiratory specimen positive sars cov study also measured vaccine efficacy preventing severe covid measuring well vaccine may prevented infection covid coronavirus first place reasons think distinction important include isssues like covid even asymptomatically cause lung scarring unknown duration seems ensure months years follow symptoms care logical vaccinated person still subject scarring long hauler symptoms b people misinformed thinking catch disease vaccine likely get spread us yet able get vaccine enough everyone yet,tri post anoth sub immedi shout forgot redditor allow non conform thought covid sub duh best sub question give go use sub among best prepar pandem think wide understood two covid vaccin grant emerg author us proven prevent get spread covid even necessarili design prevent get diseas carrier infect other vaccin focus symptom develop person got inject later avoid seriou covid symptom determin vaccin work think hear word vaccin think averag joe us hear word vaccin understand mean inject prevent us get spread viral diseas one variou reason say still wear mask social distanc wash hand even vaccin vaccin work way compar one read far tb vaccin prevent vaccin person acquir tb develop tb symptom prevent extra tb sever form ill vaccin sens word usual use call vaccin us cdc page updat jan benefit get covid vaccin covid vaccin might prevent get covid get covid vaccin might keep becom serious ill develop seriou complic forb vaccin prevent infect viru far publish data seem realli answer question exampl decemb public new england journal medicin describ investig measur efficaci pfizer biontech vaccin phase clinic trial far determin well vaccin seem prevent confirm covid defin presenc least one follow symptom fever new increas cough new increas short breath chill new increas muscl pain new loss tast smell sore throat diarrhea vomit along respiratori specimen posit sar cov studi also measur vaccin efficaci prevent sever covid measur well vaccin may prevent infect covid coronaviru first place reason think distinct import includ isssu like covid even asymptomat caus lung scar unknown durat seem ensur month year follow symptom care logic vaccin person still subject scar long hauler symptom b peopl misinform think catch diseas vaccin like get spread us yet abl get vaccin enough everyon yet
1765,An Internal Maternal Mask Debate,"I am mostly isolated and can easily afford to upgrade to KN-95 masks for my few excursions.  A few dollars a week is easy to justify given that a single day of missed work is what a single day of missed work costs, much less the cost of medical intervention in the USA!

Then there's my mother.  She isn't nearly as cautious as we would like.  I video chat with her at work sometimes, and if I say, ""What?"", she'll pull her mask down around other people and repeat herself.  She still eats in restaurants.  RESTAURANTS!

She works with children too young to mask and I'm really tempted to get her KN-95s because I think she'll wear them, but I would feel the pinch getting more than a couple months worth for her, and I wonder if her incautious actions would negate most of the benefit.

It wouldn't negate \*all\* of the risk reduction, would it?  She would sometimes be more protected.  Namely, the times she wears a mask properly.  Which she's gotten better at over time, but . . . well, still far from perfect.

I've seen that a cloth mask over a cheaper surgical mask is also pretty great, but she dismissed that idea quickly and I doubt I'll win on that front.  Better to save my convincing for more winnable arguments if I can.

Well, I don't know.  I've consulted the siblings, as they're similarly exasperated but interested in improving her odds.  What do you all think?

1766,Regarding new variants and vaccine,"I spoke with someone I know who works at a university a few days ago, and was told this...

&gt;Ok, so the LA variant is L452R.  First detected in Denmark in March 2020.  Vaccine will likely work against it.  

&gt;Think of it this way - for each variant the vaccine may have different efficacy rates.  So for the lab tested variant with spikes, it can be up to 95% effective.  But as it changes, say for B117, it might be only 79% effective due to different spikes on the covid molecule.  It might be 40% effective on L452R, and minimally effective on the South African variant. For example sake only.

&gt;That's why Biden is pushing for fast mass vaccination.   If we get to 70% herd immunity, then it can't keep mutating.  Then we just monitor worldwide hotspots like we do for H1N1 and Ebola and impose travel and other restrictions.

&gt;Worst case scenario is we get 40% of the population vaccinated against spiky covid and then it mutates to not-spiky-covid and we have to start over.  Part of the problem is people on various immunosuppressive drugs like chemo or those who have had organ transplants are more likely to create mutations.  Probably doesnt help that out of 1 million vaccinations in Florida that 45,000 people didn't go back for round 2.....

&gt;And that's the only state that's releasing numbers so far...

&gt;As far as cal.20c variant all they have is a correlation, but no idea whether it has caused the recent spike, whether is is more deadly, or whether it is vaccine resistant.  All they have now is a genetic sequence, and that is basically just an identification, like an ID card at this stage.

1771,Hello! COVID19 AND PETS? I'm having a panic attack. I'm sorry.,"I'm not quite sure if this is the right group to post this but I'm panicking. Like; literally fighthing a panic attaack as I write this. English is not my first language, so I'm sorry for any mistakes or typos. I'm in one of the smallest cities in Mexico. There's a total of 458 cases in the whole state, and 147 in the city where I live. I've been taking precautions and all, but I suffer from diagnosed anxiety dissorder and depression both increasing during this whole pandemic so it's been a hard time trying to convince myself that I'm taking precautions and there's nothing else I can do, literally. 

 I live with both my parents, who are above 60yrs old but they take precautions too. I share a dog with an ex boyfriend, and our dog was staying with his mom, but his mom got COVID19 so he stood with her until she was sent to the hospital, so he was exposed. Today he calls me and asks me as a favor to take care of our dog in my house while he sorts out the situation with his mom and I said yes. When our dog arrived, he was wearing a mask, I was wearing a mask, he only got closer to hand me a back pack containing the stuffs of our dog. He doesn't have the virus and he told me his mom had COVID19 on January 12; and I haven't seem him since that day until today. 

 I took the dog in, nobody pet him, I soaked his stuff in a type of bleach, washed my hands several times while I was outside talking to my ex, both wearing our masks, taking distance, I took a shower once I was inside my house and took distance with my parents, placed all the stuff I was wearing (including shoes and socks) to soak over night, threw away the mask I was wearing, took a shower, threw away the soap I used, and washed the dog with warm water and soap, threw away the towel I used to dry him. I'm panicking because I don't know what are the rules for COVID19 and pets and I don't know what to do, I'm scared for my parents even though they had no contact with my ex or the dog before I washed him. What should I do? I'm planning on wash the dog tomorrow as well.  It's just me and my parents here and I'm really scared, plus my mental illness it's making me have a bad time; so I thought about Reddit and I'm hoping someone can reply to this or send me a message.

1773,Toolbox Shop Towel/Zep’s Industrial Blue Towel Filtration,"Hi all,

I bought a 3M mask but my brother was able to get me a North Honeywell Mask from work. So doesn’t appear there are adapters from North to 3M. So I have a ton of (possibly counterfeit - waiting on results) 3M P95’s I spent a chunk on that are no longer usable.

That being said I found this guide online: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=48CA4FI9Kcs

Basically this guy is cutting out bits of an HEPA air filter as replacements for his cartridges then lining the top with toilet paper.

I would like to do this but instead of toilet paper using the Toolbox shop towels/zeps industrial as they apparently have a filtration of 93% and are pretty cheap.

My main concern is - before me, the cabin had random people in for 27+ hours. They all breathed, without masks. Even if I spray some kind of lysol in the air, the risk is still very high, right?

1785,Building Resilience &amp; Grit During Lockdown &amp; The Pandemic - This Too Shall Pass!,"Building Resilience &amp; Grit During Lockdown &amp; The Pandemic - This Too Shall Pass!

""This Too Shall Pass."" .. ""Control what you can control""

Hey friends! In this weeks episode on my podcast I share my reflections and current experience and tools that I’m gaining on building resilience and grit during the pandemic. We are experiencing a shared trauma, because that’s what the pandemic has triggered in a lot of us, an emotional response to a tragic event. Although it may not feel this way right now, you will push through, and gain the tools to manage emotionally and mentally, and this too shall pass. At this point in my journey, Grit and Resilience is the running theme, and I’m learning about it, and finding out how I can build my toolkit, will-set, skill-set and mindset to manoeuvre through my life journey. This will be one of many episodes sharing my learning and the resource, tools and processes. 

I just released my podcast episode on this, and wanted to share some highlights, and hear your experiences with this. 

&amp;#x200B;

1.**No Moment Lasts Forever**

In the present moment things can tend to feel eternal, and we can feel stuck because we don't know what's ahead. Especially during a pandemic where our days feel so repetitive, but trust and believe the carousel of life never stops turning, and this moment is one you'll like back at just like the last obstacle you had and thought you could never survive, AND YOU SURVIVED! 

 2. **Build Your Mental Strength, resilience and grit can grow.**

One guarantee in life other than death is obstacles and adversities, and because we know this, our focus should be more on how we can gain the tools to navigate through life, better equipped to handle the yin and yang of life, the ups and downs. Resilience and grit can grow, and there are so many resources that can help you build it with time and patience, one step at a time. We will invest time working out, eating healthy, getting a personal trainer to get fit and healthy and the same is required for our minds. The brain is the strongest and most important muscle, it requires nutrition and strength training too!

3. **Make your next chapter your best chapter**

Your current disposition and story doesn't have to be the one you stay stuck in. Staying stuck is a choice. You are stronger and more built to walk through life than you know! What kind of person do you want to be? What is their character, how do they respond to life obstacles, how do they treat themselves, talk to themselves etc. Now what do you need to do to get there? Make your next chapter your best! Shift from saying why to asking How. Take each day at a time and make a choice each day that brings you closer to the person you'd like to be.

I would love to hear your thoughts, experiences, challenges etc on this topic.

I found a [website](https://wellbefore.com/products/disposable-3-ply-face-masks) that advertises good prices for masks that seem like they fit the bill (all good reviews) but they were pretty terrible.  The material was difficult to breathe through, lots of leakage around the nose and around the face.  The nose only had a thin twist tie that wasn't strong enough to maintain the proper shape so air leaked like crazy there. Since it was difficult to breathe through, air would take the path of least resistance.  and I'm sure very little actually went through the mask material.

1793,Our pandemic preps in spring 2020 were a great hedge against food cost inflation,"I bought a deep freeze (got the last one) in spring 2020 and filled it with beef, pork, and chicken, plus a few non-meat things.  (We have a large family.)  I calculated that using it sparingly, the meat would last a year.  Had read that meat may not last too well, going beyond a year, deep-frozen.  Now that we're nearing the last several meals of some of the beef, I'm finding that beef prices are shockingly high in my area of the US. 

I mean beef prices are so high, on everything other than ground beef, that we basically are going to give up beef just to avoid paying exorbitant prices.  We're seeing 99 cents a pound on chicken for instance, but the cheapest cuts of beef are easily $5 to $7 per pound and up!

1796,Is there a website that is constantly updated with the disinfection methods for the new variants that are emerging nearly everyday?,"I've heard ever since early 2020 that good ol' handsoap is enough to make the original SARS-CoV-2 virus unviable. (It does this because the fats in soap emulsify/disintegrate/collapse/dissolve the virus' membrane, since the membrane is made of a fatty lipid layer, and lipids emulsify lipids.) 

But what about these new variants that I keep on hearding about in the news for the first time in February 2021, like the P.1 from Brazil, the B.1.351, and the B.1.1.7 from the UK? Would soap work on them as well? Even if the answer is ""yes"", there could be a new variant in the future that soap wouldn't inactivate, and so I would still want to know what sorts of cleaners inactive the new variant, and, if possible, which ones don't.

# Russia reports first human cases of H5N8 bird flu

*Published 14 hours ago on February 20, 2021 By BNO News*

Seven people at a poultry farm in southern Russia have been infected with H5N8 bird flu, officials say, making it the first time that the highly pathogenic virus has been found in humans. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission.

“Today, I want to inform you about an important scientific discovery made by scientists at the Vector scientific center,” Anna Popova, the head of Russia’s consumer health watchdog, said on Saturday. “The first cases of human infection with \[avian influenza A(H5N8)\] have been laboratory confirmed.”

The virus was found in seven employees at a poultry farm in southern Russia, where outbreaks of H5N8 were reported in the bird population in December 2020. Popova described the human cases as “mild,” according to the Interfax news agency.

“The virus can be transmitted from birds to humans, it has overcome the interspecies barrier,” Popova said. “As of today, this variant of the influenza virus is not being transmitted from person to person. Only time will tell how quickly future mutations will allow it to overcome this barrier.”

Popova said the discovery will help researchers prepare for the possibility of human-to-human transmission of the H5N8 virus. Detailed information about the cases has been submitted to the World Health Organization.

H5N8 has been found in birds since at least 1983 and outbreaks have occurred frequently since 2014, when it was found in breeding ducks in South Korea. Numerous outbreaks have been reported during the past 6 months, including in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, China, Japan, and South Korea.

“The H5N8 type influenza is regarded as pathogenic and is currently manifesting itself in a variety of ways, from asymptomatic and sub-clinical to highly lethal in some populations,” the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) said in an update about recent outbreaks.

Human cases of H5 viruses are rare but are typically found in those who have contact with sick or dead birds.

239 human cases of H5N1 bird flu have been reported in China and Southeast Asia since 2003, killing 134 people, according to WHO. More recently, two people in China were infected with the H5N6 variant in January, causing the death of a three-year-old girl.

“Community awareness of the potential dangers for human health is essential to prevent infection in humans,” WHO said in a public health assessment for H5 viruses. “Surveillance should be continued to detect human cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of the viruses.”

1807,"Pandemic prep- One year later - What did you expect and what actually happened, and what did you learn?","I was here last year when this sub was created (thank you!) for people new to prepping who saw the pandemic on the horizon.  I was in a low-level panic, and y’all guided me through, and the last week of February 2020 was when I did my major shopping to prepare to be locked down or locked in for several months.  

What I Expected that didn’t happen:  Supply chain disruption.  Other than toilet paper and cleaning supplies, our local grocery stores stayed open and stocked.  I really worried that the trucking industry would be hit hard by the virus.

What I expected that did happen: I’m so glad we had a plentiful supply of toilet paper.  My house has 10 people, and if we had been trying to get by on “one item per household” of 4 packs of tp we would have been in dire straits.  I’m so glad I didn’t have to worry. 

What I had enough of: canned food, personal care items, baking supplies (except yeast), meat.  I also bought way too much flu/cold medicine.  

What I didn’t have enough of: junk food, chocolate chips for baking

What I learned: I love having a “store” to pull from in my own garage.  It keeps us from buying fast food simply because I don’t have the right ingredients on hand, it has helped lower our food budget and has helped us have good food even when the budget is tight (or nonexistent). 

I use the “Food Storage” app to track which bin each item is in, and it has been both really fun to use and also allowed me to be able to send anyone down to easily find an item.

What I still struggle with:  Water storage.  I really need to have more in my preps for earthquakes, but it takes up room and goes bad after time and feels “unnecessary” until you need it.  Suggestions welcome.

The prep food is getting boring and I’m feeling less likely to replace it once it’s used. 

Reminder:  If you are like me and started prepping a year ago, now is the time to look at all the expiration dates and rotate that food.

Yesterday morning, I had a rapid nose swab test on my first day of work and I tested negative. What do you suggest I do? Is quarantining 10 days or 14 days CDC protocols? My parents told me to take Vitamin D, melatonin, and Ivermectin. My immediate family - my dad, my mom, and my sister and I - all took Ivermectin as soon as we found out my boyfriend tested positive. I was looking forward to working at my new workplace (healthcare facility with the geriatric population) as an dietary aide at 10:30am today. I emailed HR and my boss what to do.

1819,Skills and Tips for Emergencies,"Seeing how Texas recently got hit with an electrical blackout and many places having issues with their infrastructure, here are some videos to help you through certain difficult scenarios.

[How to bath and wash your hair with 1-2 gallons of water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0-LFSPLyyE) ""Traditional"" method

**Save/use the toilet sparingly if plumbing or water pipes stop working**. During the winter of 2019, the water-main to my college campus broke and no building had water for 2 weeks straight.

It was an absolutely awful experience, so this is what my dorm and I did (and learned from) and I hope this helps someone down the road:

1. Reserve one toilet in your home for liquid waste, and another for solid waste (if you have at least two toilets). Make sure to have air fresheners sprayed in the second room. This is the ""civilized"" method if your current situation isn't a literal ""shtf"" situation and plumbing is planned to be restored under a week.
2. If your toilet/plumbing situation does not ease and lasts longer than 1 week, then you may have to resort to more desperate methods to dispose of human waste. One way is by using kitty litter, and/or using disposable plastic bags with a [commode chair](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=commode+chair). Pour some kitty litter into the plastic bag lined inside the commode chair to reduce the scent of the solid human waste, tie up the bag after doing your business, then yeet that disgusting thing into the garbage can.
3. If you don't want to spent $100 on a commode chair that uses a proper seat, then I recommend a [portapotty bucket](https://www.amazon.com/Reliance-Products-Luggable-Portable-Gallon/dp/B08XXY8Z5J/) that is easily disposable after using it and your situation gets better. It's $16, which is much cheaper than a metal commode chair. Use this bucket for solid waste, and your regular toilet for liquid waste.

**Keep garbage out of the house**. Put any trash and waste outside to the curb or local garbage bin if your community has one. Do not let garbage pile up inside your home at all costs. The longer you let it sit in the house during an emergency situation, the more likely consequences will happen to you, such as rats/cockroaches/ants/etc. coming into your home.

[Make sure to have insect-killing spray](https://www.amazon.com/Ortho-Defense-Insect-Perimeter-Gallons/dp/B00C4TS86I/). This is for spring thru fall. In the case that insects do start swarming into your home, you'll need this. The last thing you want on top of an already terrible situation is one where insects are crawling everywhere like your bedroom while you sleep. Spray openings like around windows, doorways, and crevices where insects may be able to crawl through from.

**Have on hand and know how to use water bottles efficiently**. During my time for my 2019 winter incident, I used water bottles to shower because I (obviously) did not plan for or prepare for the water line to burst. I punctured about 5 holes in the cap of 1 liter water bottles (I used about 2-3 bottles per shower, hair included) and used those to shower instead of using a shower bag or other methods. If you can afford one, I highly recommend a shower bag. Showering with bottles or the traditional method is an extreme hassle if you haven't done it before.

[Invest in a water filter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08KFNQT4N/). This is for cases where your plumbing does work, but you're unable to drink from the tap or use the sink water for cooking due to water-sanitation plants being offline (take Texas for example).

**Befriend a doctor/family doctor if possible**. In the case of a medical emergency during a time when medical treatment is not readily available at your hospital for whatever reason, it would be an absolute life-saver to know an actual doctor who knows how to treat things such as wounds, and have antibiotics on hand to save your or a family member's life. Only call them in the case of an absolute emergency and your local hospital isn't able to help you.

Remember, [just a few months ago hospitals told ambulances to refuse to transport patients with low chances of survival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dcBBZ-MOSI). That could be you one day. Don't solely depend and trust on emergency services; have backup plans in case they cannot help.

[Have a portable radio](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-ICFP26-Portable-AM-Radio/dp/B012F0DGYE/). This should be your primary source for information if the electrical grid ever goes down. Using a cellphone wastes precious battery-life. Conserve your cellphone for calling and texting sparingly and low screen brightness settings.

**Check up on your neighbors** (after checking your family and friends first). Make sure the people and families around you are okay and help each other if the electricity or water is out for more than a few days if you are able to. The last thing you want is to know someone died next door when you could have found out sooner and helped them.

**Figure out how to safely light and put out a campfire/stove/fireplace**. There have been many instances where people died from carbon monoxide and other toxic gasses for a bunch of reasons.

**Don't operate a gas-powered generator indoors**. The fumes from gas-powered generators **ARE** toxic to humans and will absolutely kill you in your sleep if you use/keep one indoors. KEEP THE GENERATOR OUTSIDE WHEN IN USE!

**Stay informed**. After preparing yourself and making checks on everything and you finally settled down, keep yourself up to date every few hours (or minutes) to know what's going on and when your situation may change. Information can save your life if things turn for the worse.",PandemicPreps,1615356137,nekohideyoshi,1,1,True,2021-03-09 22:02:17,seeing texas recently got hit electrical blackout many places issues

1826,"Just some gratitude to this community, 1 year after the first lockdown","Last year, I got tuned into the coronavirus threat way back in January and became one the weirdos people who kept trying to warn everyone to prep and wear masks. I knew it was going to be big and I also knew that if there was some killer virus going around, I was going to get it because my immune system sucks and I’m sick often. I had recently discovered Reddit and having a burgeoning pandemic prepper community to turn to made all the difference in the world.

I’m naturally anxious and yet because I could use the tools you all gave me to plan for the worst, I prepped slowly but surely in fits and starts and never got overwhelmed. Those around me thought I was crazy and worried for my sanity, but I felt so calm and determined that it didn’t bother me. 

As more information came out about the virus spreading across the world, still people didn’t believe me. This community taught me to be self reliant, resilient, and independent. Literally I posted at one point asking if I should include my boyfriend in my quarantine apartment and you guys all weighed in! It was so odd to find a community of strangers who had their fingers on the same pulse, but it was incredibly comforting for me.

Of course once lockdowns happened, we didn’t need each other as much here. We all know the drill! But I just wanted to thank the early preppers for keeping me sane and maybe even alive. One year on, I’m now fully vaccinated (something I never thought would happen) and based on everything I’ve learned about taking care of myself, I feel ready to take on the world. So thank you for your good advice, for weighing in, for comparing notes, and for being there.

1829,Product Review: G95 - Biohoodie and Bioshield 2,"I felt this Reddit community was the most appropriate place for this review. I recently purchased two items from the company G95. They use a proprietary washable filter in their products that they claim filters out 99% of particles 0.1 microns or larger. I'll note quickly that HEPA filters filter 0.01 microns or larger, and N95 masks are rated for 0.3 microns or larger. A coronavirus is 0.125 microns in width.

I purchased their version of a cloth mask - the ""Bioshield 2"" - and a hoodie with their filter built in around the neck which can be zipped up and cinched tight to form a cowl-like filtration which they liken to a ""hazmat suit"" (per an email they sent me, not on their website).

The mask is incredible. It has a little extra fabric under the chin and above the nose wire, which gives it an incredibly snug fit. They also have two ways of wearing them - either with the ear elastic flaps alone, or combining the ear flaps with another piece of elastic around the head, which snaps into the ear flaps. The fit is great, and I'm relatively confident that the filtration is working - there's definitely no air escaping out the sides of the mask, so it must be going through their ""G95"" filter.

The Biohoodie is a swing and a miss. I think it's a cool concept, but poor execution. I wrote a review for their website and G95 refused to publish it because it was a 3-star review. This probably explains why their website only has 5-star reviews, and why there are *no reviews whatsoever* for the Biohoodie. Their refusal to publish the review, coupled with a somewhat snarky email I received stating that the Biohoodie is ""wasnt \[sic\] designed as a mask"" and ""\[i\]t was designed to use on the plane or the gym or any crowded place to give protection over your entire head. Combined with a Bioshield you basically have a hazmat suit just so you know.""

In other words, their vision is that on a plane or in another crowded space, you combine this with a mask, and you get ""protection over your entire head."" I'm not sure what medical purpose this could possibly solve. If you have your mouth and nose effectively covered with a well-fitted mask with effective filtration media, you don't need your hair, ears, and neck covered as well. That's a very weird premise for a $129 piece of clothing (with no return policy, btw).

As far as the fit for the Biohoodie - it runs small. I purchased a medium and I'm a medium guy for every piece of clothing I've bought since high school. This was a bit snug, a bit short on the arms, and the hood is actually pretty tight around my head. Size up if you want to buy one.

Anyway - this might be one of the only reviews for the Biohoodie on the internet. I certainly couldn't find anything via a google search or Youtube where someone actually wore the Biohoodie and talked about it. And it seems like they're stifling reviews for their product, which is poor form.

TL;DR: Bioshield 2 = great mask, worth a buy; Biohoodie = skip.

1834,How I survived a suspected exposure on the bus (fall 2020),"This was when cases were 900 a day. I was on the bus home from work when a very ill looking man boarded the somewhat busy bus. He wore his mask below his nose ansld coughed profusely.

I know I needed to act quick 

So first I held my breath at sight and moved away swiftly, 

Secondly I calculated I had about 10 seconds once I was &gt;6 feet away from him to grab a real breath of air I could hold in longer so I held my breath instead to give me half a minute to think

Thirdly I thought about brownian physics and stuffed my mouth inside my hoodie (with a jacket ontop) because those 2 things would have old air from the time before exposure. I took shallow breaths for about 2 stops then held my breath again before my home stop. 

Luckily I never got infected.

Theories at play 

1. Think of it like dodging a fart. After hearing it, you have a few seconds to flee before smelling it

2. Brownian motion at play 

3.

1846,Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Please Also Curb Inhumanity in Hospital,"Yang Amat Berhormat Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham 

On World Health Day 7/4/21 you said: ‘Govt to ensure optimal, equitable healthcare for all’. So, when Hospital Errors is the 3rd largest killer after Heart Disease and Cancer; Govt should curb unscrupulous Doctors from taking Patient's life for granted, in the Hospitals. Besides Covid 19, as President of Malaysia Medical Council, it is your duty to ensure investigation conducted by MMC are fair to all parties. 

A cruel inhumane Case from Malacca Private Hospital was sent to MMC for investigation at the end of 2010; whereby, a physically well old lady on 22/7/2010 being sent wrongly to a Surgeon (Dr T), shortly before lunch, due to sudden stomachache. Dr T allowed her Partial Bowel Obstruction, that had 90% chances of recovery with proper Conservative Management, to distend and dilate until Ischemic and Peritonitis with DIVC and multiple Organs failure, and her Bowel dead; only then operated on her on 27/7/2010.  

Preliminary Investigation Committee II of MMC conducted the investigation under the Chairman, there were 4 retired Doctors, 4 Secretariats and 1 lawyer whom only attended once in every 1 of the 3 short meetings. PIC II and Dr T’s Lawyer cross-examined the Complainant in 2 meetings. Doctors only gave Medical advice; and it was impossible for those temporary staffs to understand Medical Case. 

So, it was the Chairman that decided to dismiss the Case in the year of 2012 after the last meeting, even though it was found that the Case Notes and Medical Report submitted by Dr T were seriously deviated from the Hospital’s Medical Records, resulted in a lot of discrepancies among them. 

&amp;#x200B;

SUMMARY OF CASE EVENTS

1. Dr T did not even take Patient’s Vital Signs, which were taken in the Ward. He only used his finger tips to touch her abdomen, and told her there was traffic jam. So, after jam cleared by vomiting, she took some high fiber biscuits for lunch. Instead of making her vomit out the foods she just took; he admitted her under IV drips with Buscopan to slow down bowel movement, when it was congested with food materials.

2. At night, Dr T took Patient’s hyper-peristalsis pain on and off as gastric pain and wait for her to vomit. NG suction only inserted after her 2nd vomiting, and was pulled out for 3rd vomiting. Next morning, he refused to listen to her daughter about the 3 times vomiting, indicating Bowel Obstruction; so he did not reinsert NG suction. Dr V said NG suction prevent Bowel distention and dilatation by sucking out fluid and gas from the stomach, amount of fluid collected indicate Bowel Obstruction.

3. To pass the blame of foods taken due to fail to advise ‘nil by mouth’ to the Patient; Dr T stated in Medical Report that she admitted in the Ward, that she took some food before admission after his advice; but there was no such records in the Nursing Care Plan and Case Note. 

4. On 3rd day morning, Dr T failed to know Patient’s Bowel obstruction dilatation had deteriorated to cause dehydration even though BUSE taken shown catalysts at lowest and below normal level. So, he still did not insert NG suction; and he said based on the number of Diapers Patient’s urine very good; but Dr V said it was impossible to measure Urine with Diapers. 

5. Dr T said her condition normal in the Evening by adding another BUSE in Case Note; but  Nursing Care Plan and Laboratory Report shown BUSE only taken in the morning. 

6. On 4th morning (Sunday), Dr T asked Patient to ask her daughter to discharge her when no Relative was around, just because X-ray not done yet; and left the Hospital without examine her. He said in Case Note that he asked her to ‘AOR’ discharge because her Daughter want CT scan and he was concerned about high radiation and cost. Ironically, after he viewed the X-ray, he allowed her to take CT scan. 

7. In the Afternoon, due to no examination, even with Radiologist remarks of dilated loops of Bowel, and Bowel Obstruction either at end of Ileum or beginning of Colon; Dr T still unaware of Patient’s Bowel Obstruction’s Emergency condition; so he advised Relative to wait for her 5 days off Aspirin and declined the daughter’s request for Laparoscopic Surgery.

8. ‘Fleet Enemas and motion large amount’ noted in Case Note to mislead her Bowel not obstructed could not be found in, In-house Prescription form and Nursing Care Plan. He later confirmed Bowel Obstruction at Mid Ileum, in Court. 

9. The contradicting phrase ‘Reluctant due to risk of bleed’, Dr T scribbled in Case Note that stated ‘KIV operation waiting for Patient 5 days off Aspirin’ to pass the blame of delay in operation to the Relatives, could not be found in Nursing Care Plan, proved that it was added retrospectively.

10. To justify his postponing of emergency operation, when it was impossible to see Bowel’s diameter and number of loops, in X-rays, Dr T said it shown they were not serious. In his Witness Statement, Dr V stated that Aspirin taken 4 days ago, could not be taken as the cause of not to operate, when Patient’s raised temperature could mean impending Peritonitis.

11. At nigh, Dr T did not go to Hospital, when the Patient was having rapid  heart beat of 100 bpm, struggling on Bed in serious pain and confusion with Bulging Abdomen. Both Dr T and Dr V testified that was deadly Peritonitis with Septic Shock that need immediate operation. 

12. High blood medication still given to the Patient with Systolic Blood Pressure below 90 mmHg at 8.00 a.m. the next morning,, caused her blood pressure to drop drastically to 75/38 mmHg from 10:30 a.m. onward; proven in Hospital Meeting Transcription.

13. High Blood Medications noted in ‘In-house Prescription Form’ was being canceled; Dr T had confirmed that Patients take Medications base on condition and would only be noted when it were served, could not be noted before hand and then cancel. 

14. At 9.00 a.m., Relatives informed Dr T about Patient’s low blood pressure and requested for Nutritional therapy; he asked them to go to his next door colleague Gastroenterologist for 2nd opinion, then left the Ward without examine her; proven by his Case Note: KIV gut resection, unless Peritonitis set in. 

15. Unaware of her seriously low blood pressure at Noon, he still postponed Operation upon confirmation by Patient’s Daughter in his Clinic; proven by his ordering of CT scan and BUSE coming morning. In Hospital Meeting Transcription, it was postponed to Wed, 28/7/2010.

16. The contradicting phrase of ‘Advise bite the bullet not agree’, scribbled into the Case Note that stated ‘order CT scan and BUSE cm (coming morning)’, not found in Nursing Care Plan, again proved that it was added retrospectively to pass the blame of delay to the Daughter. His not asking her to ‘AOR’ discharge the Patient in Urgent condition proved that she went to confirm operation. 

17. At 7.00 pm, Dr T asked for consent of infusion of  blood through phone; used a ‘?’ in Case Note to deny that he knew Patient was Sepsis with DIVC before operation; but both him and Dr V had testified that Blood test shown she was  in severe Sepsis of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIVC) with multiple organs failure and her Bowel was dead. 

18. Dr T waited until around 1:30 a.m. of the next day to ask for consent of immediate operation in ICU. He did not give time for the Relatives to see Patient, and also did not tell them her Bowel was dead; and then taken her thumb print involuntarily when she was in semi conscious condition; and conducted the operation when her blood system was bleeding.    

19.  In order to change Patient’s Bowel Ischemic and Peritonitis due to Bowel Obstruction, to Mesenteric Ischemic Bowel; Dr T change her undergone Angiography 10 years ago to Angioplasty; Backache 4 months, due to fracture in lower Spinal Cord to Abdominal pain 3 to 4 months; Constipation with Fleet Enemas to loose yellowish stools; and ECG normal to Ischemic Heart, in his Case Notes.

20. He then written an untrue Operation Note of Patient’s cause of death as Mesenteric Ischemic Bowel which was caused by blockage in blood vessel that cause Paralytic Ileus, without Bowel Obstruction; but he had testified that her Bowel obstruction was at Mid Ileum, and she did not have Paralytic Ileus.    

&amp;#x200B;

CONCLUSION

There was totally no treatment only IV drips with Buscopan, without NG suction even after the Patient’s Bowel was obstructed and seriously dilated; throughout the whole 6 days of her stay. He did not examine and was unawareness of her Bowel Obstruction dilatation deterioration; so, he postponed emergency operation; and did not go to Hospital at night, when she was in critical condition of Peritonitis with Septic Shock, denied her of her last chance of survival.   

The next morning, he did not stop high blood medication; but postponed operation again. He asked for infusion of blood in the Evening when she was in Severe Sepsis of DIVC and her Bowel dead. He took her thumb print involuntarily; and asked for consent of immediate operation when she was not operable; and then changed the cause of her death due to Bowel Obstruction without treatment into Mesenteric Ischemic Bowel.  

 

BIAS INVESTIGATION CAUSED THE COMPLAINANT TO LOSE THE CASE IN COURT (2016-2018)

Plaintiff’s witness Doctor was being put out from Trial together with the Complainant’s Witness Statements based on his Medical Advice. Dr T’s Witness Statements based on those untrue Medical documents sent to MMC, were allowed to be verified during re-examination, without objection.

Without any Documented Proof of Relatives refusal of Operation; Dr T was allowed to use his own scribbling words added into the Case Notes as Relatives refused operation, to pass the blame of delay in operation to them. The Case was killed beyond Appeal with another false statement of family members refused operation, in the Submission.  

&amp;#x200B;

The Case Notes and Medical Report consisted of a lot of unfounded matters and incidences were proven in Court. The Complainant had compiled meticulously all evidences found in Medical Records, Hospital Meeting Transcriptions with the Court Proceeding Records, sent again to MMC in 2019 and then later Ministry of Health; but MMC still insisted not to justify the Case.      

Tan Sri Dr Noor,  the Complainant still waiting for you to justify the Case, so that the deceased can rest in peace. 

Thank You Very Much

1851,How to Identify genuine N95 masks.,"During this time of crisis  many are trying to capitalize on the cost of others  lives and health. One of that is selling  fake N95 masks.

What gives a N95 it's superior  filteration is it's  Meltblown Filter.  The shortage is about  that filter. A fake one won't  have that meltblown  filter  and will be made of simple spunbond fabric. While It may  provide certain filteration against  larger  particles It's  not what you're paying for.

Logos, certificates, packaging  etc are easily  forges. You cannot  rely those alone. You have to check  whether  the mask actually  has filter or not. You can easily  check  that by their seams whether it has the filter or not. This is a non destructive  test and you can make this check without  damaging  the mask in any way. You can do this check on shop, mall etc when you're  buying  the mask and avoid getting  scammed

1871,Inflation Preps,"Last month's inflation numbers came in 61% above the previous month. Next month is estimated to be higher again, but I expect them to surpass the estimates as I personally believe the Federal Reserve has no control of inflation right now and their statement about it being transitory is not accurate.  I am basing this on many factors, least of which is the fact that any hint of tapering asset purchases by the Fed sends wallstreet in a tizzy and I don't think they will do the right thing and cut off the gravy train. Their comments about inflation remind me about Ben Bernanke,the former Fed chair, who said subprime risk was contained back in May 2007 right before the housing crash.

With that said, I've come to rely on the sound minds of this group (especially the early members) and I've been putting together an Inflation Preparation Tiered response list.

1882,First Silver Bar &amp; other musings,"I just purchased my first silver bar online.  I went with a generic (they pick the mint and design) and got it just over $4 above spot per oz (not even sure if that is good).  I don't know why, but I am more excited to receive it than a kid before Christmas. 

I thought about shopping local, but our only coin dealer is 30 minutes away in a bad part of that town so I thought this would be best.

For anyone else that buys bullion online, do you have a favorite website?  For anyone specifically into silver bars, I hemmed and hawed over the Royal Canadian Mint vs generic and in the end my frugality won out. My hypothesis is that if things get real bad and I resell it the mint won't matter as much as the melt value. ALthough as I write this I realized the RCM is 999.9 vs 999 so did I make the right choice?

If what I expect to happen in the economy happens, the precious metal prices will drop in the future and then rise sharpy. I thought about waiting to buy in a dip, but my concern is that during that drop when the paper market falls off, supply will dry up and I won't be able to get anything.  My plan is to keep buying these each pay day. Between a push for EV/Solar/Battery tech and inflation I don't see how silver doesn't keep going higher.

I also considered selling some crypto and buying gold, but I would like to hear other people's opinion on the future of crypto prices and if they think crypto prices will rise or fall as more inflation sets in over 2021. In the back of my mind I could also see a US crypto ban and an issuance of a central reserve digital currency like occured in China, but I don't think this current group in the Fed/Treasury and Congress can get something like that done for several years. In my mind with the last two months of inflation reporting and J Powell's comments last week I think we're on a roller coaster that is slowly leaving the station. Kind of like when the Fed chairman at the time said mortgage defaults were limited to subprime.

1883,What's a cheap way to build an indoor or outdoor space to change clothes and quarantine items?,"Back in early 2020, I remember reading that some of you were designating certain areas as a sort of decontamination zone; a place to strip down after returning from a grocery run; adding a tray of bleach or something to clean your shoe soles, etc.  For instance, there was a family in the Northeastern part of the U.S. who was going to be primarily self-isolating except for grocery runs, and upon returning to the house they were going to use a specific room as a place to leave shoes, and change clothes there on the way to the shower, etc. I believe that was where their washer and dryer were also located.

We have a large family with some of us vaccinated and some not.  Some are not eligible to vaccinate due to being below the minimum age.  We're planning to let the vaccinated ones go back to school in August, but every day they'll be bringing home with them whatever virus is on their clothes, shoes, school bags, books, notebooks, etc.

The only separate entrance I could designate for this purpose opens onto a shared living space, the living room.  We also have a back door that goes straight to the kitchen but that gives me a gross vibe, to consider doing this where food is prepared.  

So what I need is to put together something like a decontamination zone, where vaccinated individuals who are returning from work or school (once we return this fall) will be able to leave their shoes, strip off their clothes, drop their school bags, etc.  Possibly this same area, or one adjacent to it, might be used for homework (pulling out the books and things from school) but I haven't figured that out yet.  I've considered trying to throw together a sort of privacy area made of plywood walls, right outside the back door.  Or just inside it.  I've looked at folding interior walls and could set up something like that inside, but they look kind of tippy.

I'm also interested in whether any of you have seen any conclusive proof that transmission of the virus is **never** happening via objects.  Of course we've all seen the articles saying that ""most"" transmission doesn't happen that way, and that inhaling the virus directly from an infected person is the main means of transmission, etc., but, the sources telling us that this form of transmission isn't a big worry are the same sources that spent months telling us that the virus ""was not airborne"" and ""was not spreading in the community"" and even that we ""did not need to wear masks outside of a medical setting.""  The only convincing thing I ever saw that pointed to transmission via objects was a study done in a hospital ward, where each patient was isolated and had their own air supply; the virus moved from room to room.  After watching the videos of the hallways they determined that a plastic tray or clipboard or some object had moved from Room A to Room G without being disinfected, and they pointed to that object as the source of the second patient's infection.  This was a year ago so I don't have the link handy.  I've seen nothing about that since then, other than constant, perpetual downplays and discussion of things like social distancing and mask wearing.

Anyway, I'm still operating under the assumption that there is at least a possibility that our groceries or external packaging, for example, could contain enough virus to infect one of us.  We bleach our groceries, we don't have visitors, we ""quarantine"" packages, etc.  If you have seen something definitive that would let me stop worrying about transmission via objects, I'd be interested in that too.  But my main point here is to figure out how to build a separate area, on the cheap, where people can change and leave potentially contaminated things like school bags.  Once the entire household is vaccinated in few months, we plan to stop doing that decontamination routine anyway.  Till then, there's little benefit to dropping a routine we've been doing since March 2020.",PandemicPreps,1624326986,Brills12,65,1,True,2021-06-21 18:56:26,back early remember reading designating certain areas sort decontamination zone place strip returning grocery run adding tray bleach something clean shoe soles etc instance family northeastern part u going primarily self isolating except grocery runs upon returning house going use specific room place leave shoes change clothes way shower etc believe washer dryer also located large family us vaccinated eligible vaccinate due minimum age planning let vaccinated ones go back school august every day bringing home whatever virus clothes shoes school bags books notebooks etc separate entrance could designate purpose opens onto shared living space living room also back door goes straight kitchen gives gross vibe consider food prepared need put together something like decontamination zone vaccinated individuals returning work school return fall able leave shoes strip clothes drop school bags etc possibly area one adjacent might used homework pulling books things school figured yet considered trying throw together sort privacy area made plywood walls right outside back door inside looked folding interior walls could set something like inside look kind tippy also interested whether seen conclusive proof transmission virus never happening via objects course seen articles saying transmission happen way inhaling virus directly infected person main means transmission etc sources telling us form transmission big worry sources spent months telling us virus airborne spreading community even need wear masks outside medical setting convincing thing ever saw pointed transmission via objects study done hospital ward patient isolated air supply virus moved room room watching videos hallways determined plastic tray clipboard object moved room room g without disinfected pointed object source second patient infection year ago link handy seen nothing since constant perpetual downplays discussion things like social distancing mask wearing still operating assumption least possibility groceries external packaging example could contain enough virus infect one us bleach groceries visitors quarantine packages etc seen something definitive would let stop worrying transmission via objects interested main point figure build separate area cheap people change leave potentially contaminated things like school bags entire household vaccinated months plan stop decontamination routine anyway till little benefit dropping routine since march,back earli rememb read design certain area sort decontamin zone place strip return groceri run ad tray bleach someth clean shoe sole etc instanc famili northeastern part u go primarili self isol except groceri run upon return hous go use specif room place leav shoe chang cloth way shower etc believ washer dryer also locat larg famili us vaccin elig vaccin due minimum age plan let vaccin one go back school august everi day bring home whatev viru cloth shoe school bag book notebook etc separ entranc could design purpos open onto share live space live room also back door goe straight kitchen give gross vibe consid food prepar need put togeth someth like decontamin zone vaccin individu return work school return fall abl leav shoe strip cloth drop school bag etc possibl area one adjac might use homework pull book thing school figur yet consid tri throw togeth sort privaci area made plywood wall right outsid back door insid look fold interior wall could set someth like insid look kind tippi also interest whether seen conclus proof transmiss viru never happen via object cours seen articl say transmiss happen way inhal viru directli infect person main mean transmiss etc sourc tell us form transmiss big worri sourc spent month tell us viru airborn spread commun even need wear mask outsid medic set convinc thing ever saw point transmiss via object studi done hospit ward patient isol air suppli viru move room room watch video hallway determin plastic tray clipboard object move room room g without disinfect point object sourc second patient infect year ago link handi seen noth sinc constant perpetu downplay discuss thing like social distanc mask wear still oper assumpt least possibl groceri extern packag exampl could contain enough viru infect one us bleach groceri visitor quarantin packag etc seen someth definit would let stop worri transmiss via object interest main point figur build separ area cheap peopl chang leav potenti contamin thing like school bag entir household vaccin month plan stop decontamin routin anyway till littl benefit drop routin sinc march
1884,How the pandemic has changed the world of sales,"  

*Article researched and written by* [Charles M. Vaughn](https://fredericacade.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/press-release-charles-michael-vaughn-atlanta-man-indicted-for-defrauding-investors-in-ponzi-scheme/)

The systems and processes that were once seen as unchangeable in the world of sales, have been disrupted and forced to change because of the transformation caused by the pandemic. Businesses have realised that by being flexible and adapting innovative ways to keep up with the changing conditions, they can not only survive but also increase their efficiency and profitability levels. 

## Disruption

Sales was traditionally seen as an area with a focus on person to person interaction. At the backend the sales meetings, induction training and workshops require intensive interaction to train and prepare the sales staff. At the front end, the sales personnel need to interact with the customers to pitch the products and sell the products and services. 

The pandemic threw a wrench at this whole process by limiting movement and transferring the bulk of communication to the online medium. The sales function has perhaps been the fastest one to adapt to the new normal because the livelihood of every business is linked with the efficient functioning of the sales department. 

By switching over to distant working and online selling, businesses have realised that they can not only survive the pandemic but also create new opportunities that were previously not possible. 

## Sales Model Revamp

The pandemic has revamped the traditional sales model. As countries closed down, more and more businesses moved to online selling. The most immediate impact of this change has been an increase in the velocity of sales.

According to a survey by McKinsey, almost 70% of the buyers now prefer to buy online instead of visiting the store or vendor. Similarly over 60% of the buyers are showing increased tendency for high value orders, as compared to pre pandemic levels. 

The time people spend travelling to shops has been reduced. It takes less time to open an app and order online, as compared to travelling to the shop, thus leading to more sales and increased profitability. 

## Geographical Borders

Secondly, this has broken down geographical barriers. A store that could previously only host buyers from the vicinity, can now easily sell products to a global audience. This has allowed businesses to focus on previously unavailable niches and segments. While this has removed the limitation on the customer reach, this has also made competition more intense because the barriers have been removed for every business. 

## Downsizing

One of the outcomes of businesses transitioning to online selling has been a reduction in the workforce. Sales personnel have been at the receiving end of this transformation. While this has ticked up unemployment figures, the outcome for businesses has been positive.

Downsizing reduces the costs and ends up giving the business a more competitive workforce. How? Businesses do not lay off employees randomly. They choose the weakest sales personnel, this leaves behind the strongest sales personnel who can then effectively deal with customers in a better manner. 

## New Skills

All of this has created a need for those in the sales function to upskill. Traditional skills such as good intrapersonal communication are still required but there is also a need for digital literacy. Employees need to be able to easily use distant working platforms, understand the ethics of online meetings to avoid embarrassing situations and keep the online interactions thoroughly professional. 

However in addition to digital literacy, there is also a great need to develop skills that involve greater perception and empathy. In a client meeting for instance, the sales personnel need to exercise greater perception and empathy to understand the body gestures through the online medium. They also need to understand that the clients too are digitally overworked and exhausted and so a meeting that could previously go on for an hour, now has to be cut short to half an hour or less. This involves the ability to deliver the message quickly and effectively.

The world of sales is changing amidst the digital and fintech revolutions. Eventually this transformation will cover every other sector of economy and department of business. Therefore flexibility and the ability to adapt in a transformative environment is going to be the key for survival and growth in the coming years.

1891,Truth about the plandemic,"
what must be understood is that this is not a scam but a crime against humanity in three stages according to the traditional pattern, action, reaction, solution.
 action: to create a psychosis thanks to the media with a banal virus.
 reaction: the terrified population threw themselves on fake vaccines, which are nothing but irreversible genetic poisonings, by injection of DNA and mRNA.

1892,Storing Mask,"What is the best way to store masks? Is it okay to store new masks in a zipper bag? Do I need to add something like silica gel or oxygen absorber?

As for the used mask, I read that it's ideal to use a paper bag. Can I just put it in the bag or should I, say, spray it with liquid hand sanitizer or alcohol? 

For a side note, I need to store used masks because I'm staying at home and sometimes use a mask for a very short time when I need to receive some package in front of my house (like a very brief 2 minutes) or when I take my dog for a walk (like 30 mins max and I walk her in an outdoor area with almost no one around.

1913,KN95 Mask Seal,"Hello,

Up until now I've been using 3-layer cotton masks (2 cotton and a non-woven material sewn between), but I recently got some KN95 masks from Costco. I feel that all around my face they have a great seal, but I can't get a proper seal at my nose. 

I've tried flattening the wire first and using both hands to form it to my nose, along with buttons on a headband to make it tighter, have also tried ear savers, but no matter what I do I get a lot of air leakage.

I do have a rather prominent nose so I think that may be the cause. Earlier in the pandemic I tried the pantyhose trick for getting a better seal on my masks but my nose created a big gap between the pantyhose and my face on either side. In fact the only masks I've ever worn that haven't fogged up my glasses at all are my cloth ones, as they have a strong wire that goes along the whole top to mould to my entire face. 

Is there anything else I can try to improve the fit of these KN95s?

* Durability
* Vocal clarity (how much each muffles one's voice)

I’ve never ordered food off Amazon before. I can’t spend more than 40-50 dollars for each order.

1922,Feeling...lost,"I'm glad I started prepping last month but wish I'd done more. I'm looking for hand sanitizer and antibacterial wipes as I only got a few small packs of each last month. Each day for the last few days I've done the rounds of a Walmart or 2 and 3 local dollar stores looking for said items along with some other goods. I'm good on tp, paper towels, lysol wipes and disinfectants for a good month or so and hoping supply chains will be better by then. I've also signed up to receive alerts from Amazon and Walmart on a few items that are due to be in stock by April.

That being said, I keep getting triggered lately with all this news. I know the statistics that as a 35yo male in good health I should be fine. However, I'm a first responder and my wife works in a hospital so we're also at a higher risk. We also have a 4yo who's in school. We wash our hands every couple hours and use hand sanitizer when out in public. 

But all this news and politics is killing me. Why didn't trump do x? Tons of cases are bound to explode next week. No vaccine for at least a year. Why aren't we testing more people? 20% of cases require hospitalization which will cripple our Healthcare system. Poorer people will go broke and can't afford to take time off work. Why don't we have universal Healthcare to cover this when we're bailing out 1.5T for private sector companies? And on and on.

I get so angry and agitated about it all and wonder why we've come to this. I'm hoping this doesn't affect me nor my family but chances are it will. It just seems like we're woefully under prepared for this and the politics and bickering in general is killing me.

You can also use a slow cooker for this. Strain and refrigerate or freeze. You can use this broth to flavor rice or better yet make soup....just add some seared meat and more veggies, season to taste and you have super healthy veggie soup.

1930,"Prepped for 3 weeks worth of food, and panic buying started yesterday in my country. Now I'm afraid 3 weeks isn't enough, any advice on next steps will be much appreciated...","The second the spread became apparent in Europe I started 'prepping'. It was last minute I started to become a prepper, the week of March 2. Everybody went: chill, everything is normal! Why would you! So, I thought, let's not overdo it, let's just get a little 3 weeks worth of food, because then there's no ""lose"" situation. Win: I won't have to go to the supermarket in a few weeks in case this blows over, Win: I have prepped if it get's worse instead.... Now, even tho I've prepped, I'm afraid it's a lose, and I need some advice. Yesterday in my country, panic set in. Today, pictures of empty shelves all over social media of my friends and acquaintances. Ordering online isn't possible anymore either. The problem is, I am worried I didn't get enough. What's going to happen in the next 3 weeks: everyday, the chances of getting infected or being infected and spreading to others increases. Everyday, picking up an item from the grocery store that carries the virus on the surface gets more likely. Everyday, more strict measures will be taken by the government... By the time I'm out of food, the world will be completely different. We're less than 3 weeks ""behind"" on Italy in our country, and see where they are. They have restrictions on how much you can buy, how many people can be inside the supermarkets, and there are lines. Loads of people, clustered together to get food. I don't have masks (the country was low on them even before we had the first case, I wouldn't even know where to buy them), the other people in the supermarkets won't have masks. If I go to the shop this weekend, I will be clumped together with loads of unprotected people, but the later I go, the bigger the chance I will contract or spread the virus, more types of products might not be available anymore, and I can't predict if the panic buying will slow down or not...

1932,"If you’re new, it’s not yet “too late” to food prep, but it will be soon","For reference: I’m in MD, which is more mid-Atlantic but whatever

I was not a prepper before this virus came along. But in late January, I started noticing what was happening in China and how they were fighting over supplies and running out of masks. I started to see it grow and wondered if it would be in the US soon. At that point I bought a reusable respirator, gloves, disinfectant, and goggles for me and my husband, and encouraged my mother and sister to do the same. My husband thought I was nuts. My mother and sister bought them, but had no idea what I was talking about. 

But things didn’t move here as quickly and I let people get in my head about it not being bad and not time to worry. So I didn’t prep food and just continued buying week to week as I normally did. Then this week everything just exploded. My grad school went remote, my job is looking to go remote, everyone is panicking, and this thing is now moving at a rate I never anticipated. I was happy to have my ppe, but that’s all I had. 

I realized I only had enough food to maybe last us a week of quarantine. Amazon Pantry is wiped out. I read here that your stores are packed with long lines and fighting, and shelves are empty. I worried that it was too late to get prepared. But I forced myself to get in the car and drive today to the store. Got a good plenty of things. While most TP and cleaning supplies are definitely gone, I was able to get sensible things like canned goods and shelf-stable items. I was also able to stock up on cold meds, mucinex, and sudafed. But things are starting to run low and people are starting to catch on. Some stores are already empty of prep items, but there are still items to be had. I anticipate things will only get worse as the declaration of national emergency will trigger more panic. 

Don’t let posts about empty stores make you think it’s too late. But now is the time because it will be too late soon. If you need something, go now. It’s your last chance. 

Maybe I don’t have 6 months worth or anything, but I feel much more at ease. I know we could last a month or so on what I’ve prepped today and that feels like success enough until a system for food shopping gets hammered out and we can use our ppe to get out, restock, and ride this thing out as long as it takes.

1938,Prepping had to wait til today because I don't own a car in a small town,"Once a month I rent a car to go to appointments out of the city and shop. Today was that scheduled day. I prayed that things would hold on til today. It's cheaper to use the bus and rent a car once a month than to own even a cheap car. I never wanted to go back to my midwest hometown, but I had to start from zero a few months ago. Rent is cheap. The population is old, poor, and/or uneducated. The jobs suck. The virus is going to hurt this city HARD.

I couldn't go out and prep beforehand. And even though I've been watching the virus since December and knew this was serious, it didn't click that I needed to prepare until another coworker mentioned that it wasn't a matter of if, but when. I've been so utterly busy with new job that I just didn't process that I needed to prepare for it. And I've considered doing some prepping in the past (before the bad stuff in my life went down).

Once it did, I prayed things would be normal until today, so I could get what I needed without huge hassle or markup. No one here was thinking about it til yesterday. I got Clorox wipes yesterday, and it wasn't the last ones. All this week I've been watching and worrying it would go to hell before I would have a chance to stock up and buy things I need. That stores would be closed or public transit/car rentals shut down.

I did what I could today. My credit card cries every month I do my big shopping, but it especially did this time. I go to Costco and get things for the apartment. Each month, I realize what I'm still missing. My last 'needs', I felt, were a vacuum cleaner and wire shelving because I have no pantry. Then I could finally just live and up that savings account back to where it used to be. Slowly.

The Costco was prepared and people were shopping. Yesterday was their biggest day. Today will be bigger. If you needed it, you could still get it. Nothing was out (except the usual tp, paper towel, clorox, bleach) when I was there. People weren't shoving or screaming or fighting. It was still civilized. There were abandoned carts with food in them everywhere though. And the checkout lines? Faster than normal. There was maybe a 5 min wait because you were at most 3 deep. And they checked you out fast. They were handing out sanitizing wipes for the carts when you entered, but nothing else out of the normal. No limiting people in the store or social distancing or masks.

I had three trips and probably spent $600-700 dollars. Because even if the stores have stocks of food even after SHTF like in Italy...I might not be able to restock. I don't have a car. I hadn't yet really bought a lot of staples for food because of moving and starting from scratch. I'm young. I will continue to prep for that deadly second wave, if it follows the Spanish Flu.

So, I prepped what I could. There are certainly gaps. I don't have dehydrated milk at all (I don't think they are stocked in our grocery stores). There's not enough fruits, veggies, dairy, meats (I eat little anyways). But I have a smaller fridge and freezer so I can't stock up on some things well. I didn't even go down the freezer, meat, or refrigerated aisles. Except butter I got.

I did get that vacuum cleaner, but not the shelving. Everything I brought is sitting on the living room floor to be processed. I have to set up Grocy, which will help keep the food organized and let me know when something might be close to expiring. I might post again about Grocy once I've set things up. I think preppers would love this tool to better track their pantry.

Also, there's no Midwest first hand account flair. I know we're backwater (or like one person said on reddit, a third world country) but I don't know what else I would call my state. The movie Fargo isn't an exaggeration. So I did 'Food Preps' flair instead. I'm sorry if it's totally wrong. I was prepping for food.

I've been on conference calls with our state department of health nearly every day for a month. I told my husband a month ago that we need to prepare and he mocked me. He has no respect for me whatsoever. So I prepared for us and our kids. Each week I stocked up on more essentials. He says I'm panicking and silly. Last week I told him we need to come up with a plan for our kids so they aren't with his parents any more. His dad is a transplant recipient. If he gets COVID, he dies. My husband sent the kids to his parents today. I pay all the bills and now I can't even depend on him to make responsible decisions. I'm not a layperson. I have training in epidemiology and am a part of my agency's incident command structure. I have read all the studies I can find. I don't watch TV or news.

1942,Reality setting in.. how do you cope?,"This is likely going to be a bit of a vent, (also potential TW) but I'm hoping maybe someone can offer up some advice or insight on how you cope with the mental aspects of this all.

I'm in Ohio, shit is really starting to take off here now that school is closed and with the US updates today. Luckily, I found this sub a few weeks ago and prepared as much as I could financially in the meantime. I'd say I'm stocked for 3 weeks for me, and for my dog, maybe 5. 

I guess at this point what I'm struggling with how to detach from all of this. I keep doubting that I'm prepared enough. I went to the local Walmart today to just top off a few hygiene items and seeing the shelves so low instantly set off a panic. It wasn't even so much the food that did it, more so the pet aisle when I saw how low it was getting.

I have a history of poverty and have lived out of my car before, and there have been periods of life where I've been unable to adequately feed my dog or myself (though I always put my animal first). It's shameful to admit, but it's the truth, and now that I'm better off (but still paycheck to paycheck), I've made sure she's had the best care possible, and I live pretty privileged, too, compared to what was before. I'm very grateful because I have full time employment already working from home, and my job is safe. When I'm being rational, I know that I'm going to be okay as far as money flowing in.

But, the thought of running out of resources again terrifies me. I had to calm myself down in the middle of the store because for now, I'm broke. I can't afford any more prep at this point even if I wanted to. I did look online to make sure if push comes to shove I can order more dog food using my credit card or something, but I'm not sure how to detach from all of this and relax. I find myself glued to my phone, checking the internet for updates, checking stocks of things online and wondering if I should pull from the little savings I have.

I think my history in poverty is really what's pushing me over the edge. The fear of myself or my animal being hungry is straight up sending me spiralling. I relapsed because of it, in terms of my ED, and I don't want it to get out of control. 

Thanks for letting me get all of that out. I just really feel like I need to talk to someone who can relate, who is taking this seriously and isn't going to think I'm insane. But now to the point of the post.. what do you all do to detach? How do you stop yourselves from constantly refreshing online, from opening your eyes and thinking about this right away? I don't want to let it consume my life.

1943,Suggestions for your last food run,"First, I can't tell you all how thankful I am for your help in this sub. I started prepping on Feb 26. I know that sounds late, but things here in New Hampshire have been same old until today. (At least where I live.) I started prepping in secret and slowly clued my family in as they started to worry. Finally today they all looked at me and said ""Thank you for prepping!"" 

I did my last grocery run today for fresh stuff/meats because that's what my family is used to eating. The Walmart I stopped by was close to empty on so many things. No water (not even seltzers), no TP or other related products, no pads/tampons, no soap or sanitizer/wipes, etc. Plenty of shelf stable foods completely gone, but fresh sections and meat sections close to normal. Same with candy/snacks. They did have an Animal Crossing Nintendo Switch....! (Very excited to add the new AC game to my preps when it releases next week. Such a good game for relaxing which is so necessary right now)

**Protein:** 

\-Eggbeaters. I picked up 4 of these and they last in the fridge until July. These are very versatile and my family is used to eating eggs for breakfast most every day.

\-Kielbasa. I picked up 6 of these. They can come already cooked, feed the three of us for one meal of protein, and are good for pasta, stir fry, and more.

\-Hot dogs. We have a fire pit that we will use as it gets warmer. These are also good on a grill. Bit of a comfort item. Same with s'mores makings as a treat and family activity.

**Vegetables:**

\-Frozen Zucchini Noodles. Good to break up the monotony of regular noodles if you can find them. I found 'em at Walmart today. We like to spiralize, but without access to fresh it's nice to have this option.

\-Carrots and Celery. Eat 'em raw, put 'em in soup, stir fry, etc. Very versatile and keep quite a while in the fridge. Celery is good with peanut butter which y'all probably already have.

\-Broccoli, asparagus, spinach, salad mix, whatever you regularly buy. We bought these for the next two weeks. After that we will decide whether to attempt delivered groceries or slowly switch to our frozen/canned alternatives.

**Dairy:**

Milk. Was almost sold out, but got one last half gal. We only use it for coffee, so we don't need much. Wanted to wait so we could have the latest expiry. Shelf stable milk and creamer are gone but regular milk is still available here.

Yogurt. You can freeze it for smoothies, it's good for digestive health, and it lasts a good amount of time in the fridge. Good in smoothies too, I'll be using it with my frozen mixed berries.

Cheese. You probably already prepped this, but get your favorite cheeses and a mix based on the meals you will be making.

**Treats:**

\-Ice cream! If you have freezer space I highly recommend this. My favorite is Talenti, and while it's too expensive for me to buy often I got two as a treat for me.

\-Easter candy. Many have said this before, I'll say it again. We don't even celebrate Easter, but still like to have something to look forward to.

\-Chips. Our favorite is Fritos, and it's even divided on whether scoops or regular are better! Bought 3 bags of both. Also might consider a variety pack of chips. I'm a huge snacker...

\-S'mores. I mentioned it above but graham crackers, marshmallows, and choc are good for over a fire but also the microwave!

&amp;#x200B;

That's all I can think of. Let me know if you have questions or suggestions. I think I'm done with grocery shopping for quite a while however. Best of luck and stay safe everyone!

1948,Australia situation - south east Melbourne. Other experiences ?,"Local butcher shelves were emptied out. Local big supermarket chains have crowds each morning with people rushing to grab toilet paper, tissues, paper towel. (Seeing the crowds so crammed in pushing and shoving each other shows how easy it would be for someone to infect a whole crowd) Other shelves looking bare, mainly the typical pasta, sauce, rice etc. People trying to buy chest freezers, shelvings for sale everywhere as well as buckets and storage tubs. Still plenty of food being restocked everyday, people here seem to be buying 3-4 months worth of food in each shop which leaves the shelves emptied for anyone else. Anyone that can’t get to the supermarkets at opening times are struggling to get basic needs. Hand sanitizer, masks, soaps etc being stockpiled. Pretty interesting and it’s just the tip of the ice berg here.
Lots of people not happy that the government is keeping schools and unis open for the meantime, they do say it’s inevitable though that they will all shut. They seem more worried about implications of removing parents from work, students education being disrupted then the possible infection spread. Schools are mainly shutting when someone at the school is testing positive for the virus. Then they backtrack and inform anyone that may of been in contact with them. 
Testing kits aren’t in massive supply although they are injecting a lot of money into the infrastructure to handle this pandemic. It’s in the early stages here still, people I was telling to begin prepping last year are now messaging saying they wish they listened. 
A lot of people don’t take it seriously, and I’m not a paranoid guy wearing a full suit and mask to the shops but at least I’m able to draw the line on unnecessary social interactions and minimising my exposure, don’t get people that want to act like there’s nothing going on and it won’t come near them. Yes Australia is more segregated then Europe and even though we are behind in numbers, and infection rates it only takes 1 day to double or triple those numbers.

1949,This is why we prepped,"I'm located in the Raleigh, NC area.  NC only had 3 cases of CV a week ago but jumped to 23 due to local Biogen employees that were infected at a conference in Boston.  Several private and magnet schools started to close last Mon/Tues as well as several smaller school districts in the state.  Wake County is the 16th largest school district in the US with about 150k students.  Wake stood firm all week by not closing but by Friday ~15% of parents had pulled their kids out.  The district sent a letter out Fri night again saying they were not closing.  Fast forward to this afternoon.  An elementary teacher in the district tested positive and 20 mins later the district closed schools until Mar 27.  (Note: about an hour after that Gov. Cooper closed all schools in the state.) The teacher got sick Tuesday and taught through the week.  So, estimate 30 kids in class and then add their siblings, parents, friends, co workers, people at places they shopped and ate, etc etc, possibly infected.  Here is a photo of the school late this afternoon.  http://imgur.com/a/dfQ0tQa We all prepped for this and I sincerely believe we all need to bug in.  I know I am.

1954,REMEMBER TO SPLIT YOUR SUPPLIES,"In the last days I've seen lots of your pictures of shelves, sideboards and furnitures full of food and cleaning supplies. You did a good job, but most of you forgot a basic rule for a prepper: **split the supplies** and put them away in several places.

This is crucial because:

* to whoever is concerned of a possible increase of home invasions related to a disruption of supplies, you don't want the thieves to easily find (and take away) your entire supply of face masks/disinfectant/gloves/food
* if a mouse/rat enters your house, you need to minimize the chances he will contaminate your food or destroy your protective gear
* if your neighbor will come to ask food or protective gear, or you'll have friends for dinner, you don't want 'em to see all your supplies. Be a grey man and hide your stuff because envy is bad and will be amplified during a catastrophic event
* If you have children or pets...you know they destroy things
* in case of an accident (flooded basement - small fire) you don't want to lose all your supplies

&amp;#x200B;

So basically you need to **minimize the risks of losing your stuff** if an accident will occur. As per the current situation, your most precious items are face masks, goggles, gloves, soap, chlorine and food. You can split the supplies and put them in different boxes around the house (garage, attic, basement, your car).

1956,REMEMBER TO SPLIT YOUR SUPPLIES,"In the last days I've seen lots of your pictures of shelves, sideboards and furnitures full of food and cleaning supplies. You did a good job, but most of you forgot a basic rule for a prepper: **split the supplies** and put them away in several places.

This is crucial because:

* to whoever is concerned of a possible increase of home invasions related to a disruption of supplies, you don't want the thieves to easily find (and take away) your entire supply of face masks/disinfectant/gloves/food
* if a mouse/rat enters your house, you need to minimize the chances he will contaminate your food or destroy your protective gear
* if your neighbor will come to ask food or protective gear, or you'll have friends for dinner, you don't want 'em to see all your supplies. Be a grey man and hide your stuff because envy is bad and will be amplified during a catastrophic event
* If you have children or pets...you know they destroy things
* in case of an accident (flooded basement - small fire) you don't want to lose all your supplies

&amp;#x200B;

So basically you need to **minimize the risks of losing your stuff** if an accident will occur. As per the current situation, your most precious items are face masks, goggles, gloves, soap, chlorine and food. You can split the supplies and put them in different boxes around the house (garage, attic, basement, your car).

1982,The MegaGuide for the Flu Pandemic Survival and Preparedness: The MegaList of Things to Have,"I've finished it, finally. It's based on many resources I can find on the internet. I've put them below in the References section.   


This guide has something called **Level of importance**, which means dividing things to buy and have based on their relevance to COVID-19 preparedness. I divided it on my own. You can disagree if you want and create your own version of the level. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Level of importance explanation:**

\- **SUPER PRIMARY**: Very urgent and important. To be prepared before the majority doing the same thing as you or panic and chaos happens. You should have it in hand and in adequate amounts

\- **Primary**: Urgent and important. To be prepared after you’ve finished preparing the SUPER PRIMARY items and whether you have the budget. You are allowed to not have it all in hand, but it’s preferable to have most of it.

\- **Secondary**: To be or not to be prepared after you’ve finished with preparing the primary items, or whether you have the budget. You are allowed to not have it all in hand, but it’s preferable to have most of it.

\- **Tertiary**: To be or not to be prepared after you’ve finished with preparing the secondary items, or whether you have the budget. You are allowed to not have it all in hand, but it’s preferable to have most of it.

\- **Depends**: Very important. Depend on the status and situation: having a pet, elderly in presence, kids in presence

\- **Optional**: Not urgent and not important but sure adds something to your preparedness. You are allowed to not have it all in hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Here it is, hopes it is useful to you and your close ones. Stay safe and stay negative!

&amp;#x200B;

**The MegaList:**

# 1. Wearable Survival Gear

SUPER PRIMARY

1986,Step by Step Guide on Buying Things for Prepping in the Flu Pandemic,"Hey, so I've thought and been reading here and there that some people weren't properly planned on the buying and collecting phase. I know that some of us have a tight budget, carefully planned future financial plan (before the pandemic), or all the money in the world, etc. Me, I have a tight budget because I'm in college as of now. But I think money shouldn't have to be a problem. 

Even if we couldn't afford some items or supplies, we can be creative on DIYs, makeshifts, and alternatives. We just have to do smart-planning. 

Here are some steps I've been doing in the past few days that I would like to share to you all. My total expenses are now at ±$100, for lasting I think 2-4 months. in my country here, $100 is among the lowest monthly salary it could be.


Here it is:

1. Research what items are needed on a flu pandemic. Just research, don't buy yet.

2. List items that you already have and you don't have.

3. Research (compile and compare) prices on the most essential items first. Which in my opinion is for transmission prevention: antiseptics, disinfectants, etc. If you can afford them, at least have them in a small amount for now. Small amount.

4. Research, (compile and compare) prices from there until the very least essential items, items that depends on your status and condition, then optional items. If you can afford them, at least have them in a small amount for now. Again, small amount.

5. Keep on updating your lists of daily carry supplies, stored supplies, and want-to-buy supplies daily. The principle is at least having the items in a small amount, rather than not having it all when needed.

6. When you've calculated that some items need to be added up, add it up daily. And if you can afford it.",PandemicPreps,1581698333,al85368,2,1,True,2020-02-14 08:38:53,hey thought reading people properly planned buying collecting phase know us tight budget carefully planned future financial plan pandemic money world etc tight budget college think money problem afford items supplies creative diys makeshifts alternatives smart planning steps past days would like share total expenses lasting think months country among lowest monthly salary could research items needed flu pandemic research buy yet list items already research compile compare prices essential items first opinion transmission prevention antiseptics disinfectants etc afford least small amount small amount research compile compare prices least essential items items depends status condition optional items afford least small amount small amount keep updating lists daily carry supplies stored supplies want buy supplies daily principle least items small amount rather needed calculated items need added add daily afford,hey thought read peopl properli plan buy collect phase know us tight budget care plan futur financi plan pandem money world etc tight budget colleg think money problem afford item suppli creativ diy makeshift altern smart plan step past day would like share total expens last think month countri among lowest monthli salari could research item need flu pandem research buy yet list item alreadi research compil compar price essenti item first opinion transmiss prevent antisept disinfect etc afford least small amount small amount research compil compar price least essenti item item depend statu condit option item afford least small amount small amount keep updat list daili carri suppli store suppli want buy suppli daili principl least item small amount rather need calcul item need ad add daili afford

1988,How do you feel the pharmaceutical aspect of the US will be in 5 months or so? As in availability of major medicines used for surgery,"I’m going to be completely honest, and some might go throwing the doomer clause at me but I really do wonder where we will be in six months. 

I have to have a c-section (my labors never progress. Oops) and I’m so nervous how things will look by my due date (if it matters, July 2). It most likely sounds silly to worry over it but I feel like there’s a huge unknown. Being pregnant and hormonal does not help LOL. 

Anyways, having to be in a hospital environment where I will need surgery and medication ect ect I was wondering what some of you think in terms of where we could possibly be in the near future. Medical opinions absolutely welcome.

Also for having a newborn coming, how would you prep? I plan on breastfeeding.

1990,The one prep I don’t see anyone talking about,"... a hospital go bag.

The reality is some of us are going to get ill and need to get to a hospital. When that point comes, you likely won’t have the strength or wherewithal to put together things you need in a hospital and cannot count that your family members will either

A few bag suggestions:

A card with your name, medical history, drug allergies, current medications and next of kin contacts.
Clean underwear &amp; socks
Deodorant, toothpaste &amp; toothbrush, hairbrush and hair ties
Clean pjs (hopefully you get well enough to want fresh clothes)
A good book or two (optimistic, but wth)
Extra power cables for phone/tablet

I bagged all this up and sealed it in a clear plastic bag. Before sealing it I wrote the date I sealed it on the outside and sealed across the writing (leaving it legible). My hope is when it arrives in the hospital with me they won’t burn it as a possible contamination risk if they see the contents were sealed long before I got sick. But also didn’t put anything I am not willing to lose in that bag.

As well, I’ve hid a spare key so that, if I survive, I can get back in to my home. I’m not counting on personal effects such as house keys not getting lost in the chaos of a hospital in crisis.

These instructions look pretty sensible to me, especially the attempt to get maximum shrinkage of the cotton via boiling for the tightest fit.  Looking [at this additional study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3373043/), which I don't think is conducted well at all and seems to reveal deep ignorance of fabric technologies, it might be reasonable to layer cotton and a cotton/poly mix in the 8 layer filter part of the mix.

1995,List of Useful Offline Apps to be Installed on Your Phones,"Hey again, I've just realized that the only items that we already have in common in this world is phone. Even though there is iOS and there is Android. And I though in a network connectivity disruption situation, offline apps would be very useful. 



Also, to be able to using it in Airplane mode will saves a lot of our batteries. Unless that the power supply is still fine, or if it isn't but you still can charge your phone through other means of energy, you can use your offline apps.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tips:**

- You can download it now for later. You wouldn't know now if there'll be any disruptions on the network providers and kills the network connections in your area.

- If you've installed any offline communication apps and file sharing apps, make sure someone or anyone have it installed too. That way you both can use it if needed later. Or just make everyone have it installed. That way we all can use it.

&amp;#x200B;

If you know other useful apps that's not listed here, let us know! Here it is. (I'm still adding on apps in the App Store)

2008,Water Purification - Recommendations?,"Hello all, 

We have a non-treated well and a large lake nearby as water sources. We are in Florida. The well is not currently chlorinated or softened and does have moderate sediment. Lake is all fresh water but obviously it’s an all natural source used for water sports with lots of potential sources for illness. 

Any tried and true suggestions for water purification options using either source for:

1. Consumption/Cooking
2. Sanitation? 

I can store up bottled from the well for sanitation beforehand but only in previously used gallon jugs. How can I ensure that the bottled water remains sanitary enough for use over time? Sediment and lack of treatment would make the well water less than ideal for cooking or drinking. Plus, well pump requires electric. I’ve seen Lifestraw before but there are three of us, maybe five if others shelter with us, plus 9 pets (we rescue) so that’s not practical.

So far I’m focusing on protection (see below with what I already have and need to still get) 

The next step will be water and food:

 Water: 

buying some bottled water
cleaning some 2 liter bottles and Filling with tap water and drops of bleach
Get a backup filter for fridge built in water dispenser
Buy two more 5 gallon jugs of water to go with my water cooler

Food: 
Buy 3 72- hour emergency food supply kits (we have 3 adults in our house) that can be used without needing to heat the water 

Try to stock a months worth of food that we eat 

Eventually get a 1 month supply of the emergency food kits like mountain house or augason farms for all 3 adults in the family 

Meds:
Stock up on acetaminophen, ibuprofen, Imodium and cough medicine

2013,What to prep for with toddler and infant?,"I’m due in the beginning of July. Planning on breastfeeding if baby is able to latch. 

I’m preparing a list of things to try to prevent sickness from being in our house. I’m not scared of dying from this- my husband and I are healthy- but I’m terrified of my child dying. Prevention is key for us which means avoiding the general public as much as possible. 

My list so far 
- canned chicken and tuna 
- canned and dried legumes 
- canned fruits
- evaporated milk 
- peanut butter 
- flour/baking soda/powder 
- salt 
- powdered laundry detergent 
- soap (maybe learn to make my own??) 
- bleach
- alcohol 
- revamp our first aid kit 
- batteries
- face masks (how many boxes do you recommend?) 
- diapers (we can use washcloths for wipes but hard no from husband on cloth diapering)
- honey

This will be supplemented with a summer and fall garden. 


Here are some questions I have 

- what do you store your dried goods in that are water and BUG tight? Live waterfront. So many bugs. So many. 
- Cheese. We love cheese. Do I just go without for a bit if SHTF? Are there any shelf stable cheeses? 
- How long should I plan on prepping for? I’m only trying to prep for the length of this virus because we can’t afford to regularly buy all this shelf stable food as well as fresh. We usually eat fresh fruits and veg that I buy weekly. When it hits our area I don’t want to go to the store at all.  


The worst part is my MIL is a pharmacist and works at CVS. In laws live next door to us, husband works with his dad. When it hits our area it is going to be tough to limit contact with them. If MIL gets it pretty much everyone in my family will get it Her &gt; FIL &gt; Husband &gt; Me &gt; Children.

2015,I’m interested in your thoughts on the power grid.,"I’ve been racking my brain for a bit here, trying to foresee any upcoming issues with the power grid if SHTF. I’m sitting on a solar generator, and a single 120W solar panel, so I’m not too concerned, but I think it’s important to discuss regardless.

I really don’t see our power grid going down in any truly meaningful way. I think there’s a possibility that there might be temporary outages, but nothing too substantial. The only way I see any lasting issues if from downed wires, as linesmen might be hard to come by in large numbers. Power plants operate at a surprisingly low number of staff.

2017,Discussion: What would you really do?,"I'm in the process of getting chickens.  3-6 or so. Enough for me and my immediate family. Which is reasonable just for the sake of fresh protein and humane treatment of animals.  Now let's pretend millions of people start fleeing the cities and we're in the Walking Dead. 

Then I think about my neighbors. Their family would likely come here if they had to leave the city. (We live in a small mountain town). My end of the road neighborhood (5 houses, 2 of which are full time residents) could easily house about 50-100 people.

We aren't rich, but the neighbors are. So, even if we barricaded the road, now what? So they abandon vehicles and walk in. I can't exactly shoot them. It's their property after all. But now I've got resources and these dumb rich city folk can't find their way put of a paper bag. 

Do you I share my eggs and garden with my immediate neighbors who I've known for years and consider friends? They happen to have a well stocked, underground wine cellar too. Years worth of fine wine from all over the world! I can see a community meal, a la Alexandria.

Do we farm our land together and share resources? They have the most open, sun laden land where as my yard is full of view obstructing trees. Plus, their family would provide extra labor to share the work. So, I definitely would be willing to share my resources with them. 

But these other strangers with the Land Rovers.....I don't know them. I do know they are assholes. (Cut down an old growth tree on an adjacent property they didn't own because it blocked their view). I don't want anything to do with them. 

Assuming they can even get here during a pandemic, I mostly see their homes as resources for my own friends and family who might show up. Or, do I trade them fresh food (avoiding food lines, stores, etc) for cash and valuables to have after the storm? I mean, I'd give up thousands of seeds for a Land Rover. I can always harvest more seeds and have plenty on hand.

2021,ATMs are cleaned approximately this often: never.,"The other day while I was waiting in line behind 9 cars trying to get to the one ATM in the area, it occurred to me:

* If pandemic panic sets in, those machines will be empty within a day to two days, tops.  Much faster in cities with large populations.  I mean the banks can refill them of course, if it's a day when the banks are open.  But if an ATM runs out at 11am on a Saturday, it's going to stay empty until at least Monday.

* I was also thinking about how I've never seen that many cars in line at that ATM before, and that there were probably some people in the area quietly preparing, just like me.

* The touchscreens and keys on an ATM are one of the dirtiest things you could touch.  I use an object to press the keys, but unfortunately with the stupid touch screens, you can't activate those with a key or pen, and end up having to touch the screen.

* A cupholder-sized bottle of hand sanitizer is a good supply to have in the vehicle, and comes in hand after a visit to an ATM.",PandemicPreps,1581981393,TeRiYaki32,21,1,True,2020-02-17 15:16:33,day waiting line behind cars trying get one atm area occurred pandemic panic sets machines empty within day two days tops much faster cities large populations mean banks refill course day banks open atm runs saturday going stay empty least monday also thinking never seen many cars line atm probably people area quietly preparing like touchscreens keys atm one dirtiest things could touch use object press keys unfortunately stupid touch screens activate key pen end touch screen cupholder sized bottle hand sanitizer good supply vehicle comes hand visit atm,day wait line behind car tri get one atm area occur pandem panic set machin empti within day two day top much faster citi larg popul mean bank refil cours day bank open atm run saturday go stay empti least monday also think never seen mani car line atm probabl peopl area quietli prepar like touchscreen key atm one dirtiest thing could touch use object press key unfortun stupid touch screen activ key pen end touch screen cuphold size bottl hand sanit good suppli vehicl come hand visit atm
2022,"Question: Would you move away from your established home farm right now, if you were already known in your community as a good place to get fresh food?","We have a small farm/homestead and produce more eggs and veggies than we can eat.

Our friends and neighbors know that we will barter food or sell for cash, and frequently stop by our house for eggs, honey, vegetables, or fruit when it's in season.

I'm concerned that we'd be overwhelmed with requests (read: demands) to purchase our food supplies, if SHTF.  And the nightmare scenario is that some friends and neighbors wouldn't take ""No"" for an answer, possibly coming back at night, or with backup, or armed.  

Worse, our home, our garden, our orchard, and our animals are all highly visible from the street.  Our house is 100 feet (30 meters) from a fairly busy road that probably gets 50 to 75 cars a day, most of which belong to people who don't live around here.  Our road is used as a shortcut for people traveling between two small cities/towns in the area, so, on any given day, there are total strangers passing by who have a full view of our large, nice property and large vegetable gardens and large chicken run.

For about a year now, we've been discussing that when and if SHTF, we'd really rather be somewhere remote and isolated, way out somewhere with no neighbors, and where no one knew us, and preferably that no one even knew we were out there.  

Am I crazy for thinking now is the time to make that happen?

Downsides:

* The only way I could pull this off financially would be to take out a huge chunk of retirement funds, and incur a 30% tax penalty for taking it out before I was old enough

* We'd be moving away from our well-established fruit trees, barn, farm animals, etc.  

* It would take 20 or 30 trips to move all this stuff and we'd never get it done in time.

So, I'm thinking I need to just hunker down here, and beef up my home defense plans.  We've been doing target practice for my teenage children to learn how to help defend the place.  Of course if SHTF the numbers of people could be totally overwhelming.

2023,Putting cotton balls in your nose is as good as a N95 mask.,"This experiment,  [Nasal Plugs for Preventing Respiratory Infections](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/147323000403200108),  indicated that the cotton ball was probably as effective as the surgical mask or the N-95 respirator in preventing transmission of infections through droplet transmission. This is a significant result because of the expense and difficulty associated with accessing N-95 respirators and surgical masks in SARS endemic areas.  


Safe use of the nasal plug requires an individual to wash their hands before inserting the plug. The nasal plug should not be pushed too deeply into the nasal cavity; the plug should be inserted into the nares to a depth directly proportional to the individual’s comfort, without the plug being too tight or loose. It is also necessary to only breathe through the nostrils, as breathing through the mouth will nullify the protection offered by the nasal plug. Nasal plugs should be removed by forceful exhalation through the nostrils rather than by using the fingers. Changing the plugs approximately every 2 h may increase their efficacy.",PandemicPreps,1581994641,javacat,23,1,True,2020-02-17 18:57:21,experiment nasal plugs preventing respiratory infections indicated cotton ball probably effective surgical mask n respirator preventing transmission infections droplet transmission significant result expense difficulty associated accessing n respirators surgical masks sars endemic areas use nasal plug requires individual wash hands inserting plug nasal plug pushed deeply nasal cavity plug inserted nares depth directly proportional individual comfort without plug tight loose also necessary breathe nostrils breathing mouth nullify protection offered nasal plug nasal plugs removed forceful exhalation nostrils rather using fingers changing plugs approximately every h may increase efficacy,experi nasal plug prevent respiratori infect indic cotton ball probabl effect surgic mask n respir prevent transmiss infect droplet transmiss signific result expens difficulti associ access n respir surgic mask sar endem area use nasal plug requir individu wash hand insert plug nasal plug push deepli nasal caviti plug insert nare depth directli proport individu comfort without plug tight loos also necessari breath nostril breath mouth nullifi protect offer nasal plug nasal plug remov forc exhal nostril rather use finger chang plug approxim everi h may increas efficaci

2025,How would you prep if you live in a major metro city?,"I’ve been pondering this question for two weeks now, living in one of the largest metropolitan cities in the US. While it’d be much easier logistically just to stay put where I’m familiar, I’m concerned how quickly things can turn if there’s a supply chain disruption, especially when most people probably have at most 3 days of food on hand and no supplies. And also infection rates in large cities with close proximity. 

We can go back to family in Canada (but they haven’t stopped flights and I’m concerned how hard they’ll be hit... though it sounds like they may be a lot more prepared medically), or temporarily move to rural areas in another state with our savings (which isa bit painful, but if the danger is real it makes sense).

The concern with leaving to another location aside from cost, trouble with relocating... is the lack of familiarity (and gun ownership), and if that may put us in more danger than the city.

There are either only real news or fake news, true information or false information.

You can only said others talk, say fake news/false information unless you have the absolutely true information.

**What is a true information, real news about the NCOV COVID-19?**

All are talking shit and giving their own opinions either from government, authority or individual.

The entity who are telling the truth about  the features, functions of the nCOV Covid-19 is the one who able  provide an absolutely working solution/medicine to solve this deadly  virus, working at least 99% on the mass.

Your understanding your statement about  the virus only correct if you able to provide a perfect working  solution, otherwise they are all either unverified, true or false.

At the end of the day, you (any  government, entities) have no rights to tell other’s opinion about this  epidemic nCOV Covid-19, because even you do not know what is the  absolutely correct one.

The number one priority now is having a working solution to solve this epidemic problems.

I remind all of you that the SARS was  solved not because of any drug vaccine made in lab house but because of  understanding the feature &amp; mechanism of that SARS correctly.

I highly recommended any international  organization or governments make a special dedicated website portal with  the purpose of seeking working solution to solve the nCOV Covid-19  problems as soon as possible.

Here are some features I suggest:

**It must has 4 main sections:**

– Your Understanding about the nCOV Covid-19.

– Solution to reduce the spreading rate.

– Solution to completely cure/solve this virus.

– Comment section for government or any entities.

\+ All are allowed to join but you must able to provide at least 2 out 3 sections.

\+ 1 profile 1 entity 1 submission. You can edit your own statement anytime you want but the time will be tracked.

\+ You will allowed to fill your contact  information at private section, but all the information display for the  public will be “anonymous” to prevent any entities taking advantage of  this event.

\+ No promotion of all kind either books, products, services or companies.

\+ The website portal must have many languages section as well so everybody can join and play.

In order to bring the best mind best  people to solve this problem, There must be a big bounty reward so not  only the doctors, researchers, scientists are doing their job, but any  other fields able to join as well. So instead of rely on few millions  people, now you will rely on few billions people. Everybody love money,  gold except the Gods with super abilities.

Overall, you can only tell either true or  false information unless you know the full features, functions of the  nCOV Covid-19, and you only know that if you able to provide an  absolutely perfect working solution to solve this epidemic. Stop  argument because that is the fact !!!

2028,Help me understand effectiveness of ethanol percentage in disinfectant product,"From post here, I found this article ""**Persistence of coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces and its inactivation with biocidal agents**""

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120300463](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120300463) 

Conclusion at the end: "" *Human coronaviruses can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces for up to 9 days. Surface disinfection with 0.1% sodium hypochlorite or* ***62-71% ethanol*** *significantly reduces coronavirus infectivity on surfaces within 1 min exposure time. We expect a similar effect against the 2019-nCoV.* "".

**My question is about that ethanol percentage of 62-71%. Does that mean higher percentage won't work or not-as-effective?**

From table 2: I can see the ""Reduction of viral infectivity (RVI)"", which shown as number (log10), see screenshot. What does that number means? 

And I cannot see direct comparison between 70% and 85% (for example), because the table only showed 10 minutes exposure time for 70% while 78% and above, the exposure time is 30 seconds.

2035,"Buy Tylenol, and Wash Your Hands."," 

India supplies the US with about 70% of the types of basic medications commonly used to treat cold and flu symptoms. China (the Hubei province in particular) supplies most of the API's (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) to India, who then manufactures the medicines and ship them to the States for processing, testing, and packaging. The linked article mentions paracetamol specifically. In the US we know it as Tylenol, but it's also known as Calpol or Panadol.

According to a report by the Times of India, prices of paracetamol have gone up 40 percent in India as the coronavirus outbreak hit production in China. It does not specify whether the price increase is due to the shortage of raw materials or plain old panic hoarding. They estimate that if supplies do not recover by the first week of March, then the Indian pharmaceutical industry could face some shortage in finishing drug formulations starting from April.

It appears to me as that the US might be facing a drug shortage at the very time they will need it most. With the repatriation of quarantined cruise ship members without significant testing and the hotspot in Hawaii our country's response to the new virus is no longer a matter of containment but mitigation. The US government itself questioned (albeit too late) their reliance on single-suppliers and admitted that the supply chain has weak points. You can watch the experts here:

[https://youtu.be/ZfB3KjGzZbo](https://youtu.be/ZfB3KjGzZbo)

So here's my thoughts. All of this is based on colloquial reporting from the internet. I am not a virologist or any kind of expert. Please feel free to point out the mistakes in my logic.

Due to our permeable borders the US will probably see clusters of outbreaks in many different locations all at once, with further outbreaks coming in waves. The timeline for when this could happen is unknown. My guess is that the 2 Japanese tourists in Hawaii who tested positive for coronavirus on Feb 14th probably shed enough virus to infect others on the islands. The US currently is not screening or testing citizens who were on holiday at the same time. These folks are going to go home and spread the virus unknowingly to others. With a 10-15 day incubation period we could see clusters across the US start to pop up around the end of February/beginning of March. The total cycle of infection seems to be between 24-54 days from exposure to recovery. (Stats on this are hard to find since the global consensus is that China is cooking their books.) That puts the first wave of demand for medicines very close to the time that the suppliers predict that they will run through their stockpiles.

2040,Research Study on the Survival of Coronaviruses in Water and Wastewater,"Research on water/wastewater and coronavirus 229E, one of the 7 known human coronaviruses, and one of those responsible for the common cold. 

Linked to pdf in this article: https://west.arizona.edu/news/2020/01/ua-study-looks-survival-coronaviruses-water-and-wastewater


Abstract: The advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome and its potential environmental transmission indicates the need for more information on the survival of coronavirus in water and wastewater. The survival of representative coronaviruses, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and human coronavirus 229E was determined in filtered and unfiltered tap water (4 and 23°C) [39.2F and 73.4F]and wastewater (23°C) [73.4F]. This was compared to poliovirus 1 under the same test conditions. Inactivation of coronaviruses in the test water was highly dependent on temperature, level of organic matter, and presence of antagonistic bacteria. The time required for the virus titer to decrease 99.9% (T99.9) shows that in tap water, coronaviruses are inactivated faster in water at 23°C [73.4F] (10days) than in water at 4°C [39.2] (&gt;100days). Coronaviruses die off rapidly in wastewater, with T99.9 values of between 2 and 4days. Poliovirus survived longer than coronaviruses in all test waters, except the 4°C [39.2F] tap water.
.................................................

Tl;dr is that coronavirus will be decreased by 99.9% after 10 days in filtered tap water at room temperature (23C/73.4F) versus over 100 days at cold temps (4C/39.F) (***possibly 588 days to reduce by 99.9% if I'm reading the chart right). Takes 12 days with unfiltered tap water at room temp. 

In wastewater, can be as little as 2-3 days until 99.9% of the virus is gone. 

Disclaimer: Idk how much the viral load needs to be reduced by in order for it to no longer be able to infect a human. But this seems like a good starting point for reference.",PandemicPreps,1582106154,Skylarias,5,1,True,2020-02-19 01:55:54,research water wastewater coronavirus e one known human coronaviruses one responsible common cold pdf article advent severe acute respiratory syndrome potential environmental transmission indicates need information survival coronavirus water wastewater survival representative coronaviruses feline infectious peritonitis virus human coronavirus e determined filtered unfiltered tap water c f f wastewater c f compared poliovirus test conditions inactivation coronaviruses test water highly dependent temperature level organic matter presence antagonistic bacteria time required virus titer decrease shows tap water coronaviruses inactivated faster water c f days water c days coronaviruses die rapidly wastewater values days poliovirus survived longer coronaviruses test waters except c f tap water coronavirus decreased days filtered tap water room temperature c f versus days cold temps c f possibly days reduce reading chart right takes days unfiltered tap water room temp wastewater little days virus gone idk much viral load needs reduced order longer able infect human seems like good starting point reference,research water wastewat coronaviru e one known human coronavirus one respons common cold pdf articl advent sever acut respiratori syndrom potenti environment transmiss indic need inform surviv coronaviru water wastewat surviv repres coronavirus felin infecti periton viru human coronaviru e determin filter unfilt tap water c f f wastewat c f compar polioviru test condit inactiv coronavirus test water highli depend temperatur level organ matter presenc antagonist bacteria time requir viru titer decreas show tap water coronavirus inactiv faster water c f day water c day coronavirus die rapidli wastewat valu day polioviru surviv longer coronavirus test water except c f tap water coronaviru decreas day filter tap water room temperatur c f versu day cold temp c f possibl day reduc read chart right take day unfilt tap water room temp wastewat littl day viru gone idk much viral load need reduc order longer abl infect human seem like good start point refer

2043,Tips for High-Energy Dogs During Quarantine?,"I live in an apartment with a husky which normally isn’t a problem because we go on 3 walks a day and a dog park every other day or so.

If &amp; when quarantine happens, I’m trying to brainstorm what to do... I have to take her out or else she will go nuts (also she poops 3x/day). I live in a fairly densely populated area so I want to avoid people as much as possible.

My current plan:
• 2 long walks a day - early morning and late evening to avoid people.
• Dog parks a few times a week early morning to let her run
• Wear a mask and goggles
• Disinfect her paws with hydrogen peroxide before going inside (my shoes as well)
• Stock up on bully sticks to keep her occupied indoors

I’ll probably buy pee pads just in case. I’m not sure how concerned I should be about disinfecting my clothes... I planned on doing that if I went into any stores, but if I’m just walking around a suburban neighborhood/parks I’m thinking a mask &amp; goggles should be enough?

2044,I've been trying to wrap my head around why most officials are reacting the way they are,"Their actions honestly don't seem to add up. They've spend a ton of money *appearing* like they're taking the virus seriously with these quarantines, but then turn around and allow *possibly* infected individuals to do as they please and silently infect everyone around them.

The best tinfoil hat theory I have come up with is that the government is actively trying to get this to spread around quickly, so that the entire populace will become infected and build up an immunity, so that it will die out before people's antibodies start wearing off, hopefully preventing the predicted highly deadly second round of infections that could allow it to sustain itself indefinitely.

Of course, my second theory is that they've fully adopted the mentality that we can bend reality to our wills and make everything okay by *saying* everything is okay... I'm really hoping it's not this one.

I stocked up on food, but I've pretty much accepted that I will get infected, and now I'm starting to wonder if I should invest in a full on hazmat suit type getup for if/when a second round hits.",PandemicPreps,1582162734,Musophobia,24,1,True,2020-02-19 17:38:54,actions honestly seem add spend ton money appearing like taking virus seriously quarantines turn around allow possibly infected individuals please silently infect everyone around best tinfoil hat theory come government actively trying get spread around quickly entire populace become infected build immunity die people antibodies start wearing hopefully preventing predicted highly deadly second round infections could allow sustain indefinitely course second theory fully adopted mentality bend reality wills make everything okay saying everything okay really hoping one stocked food pretty much accepted get infected starting wonder invest full hazmat suit type getup second round hits,action honestli seem add spend ton money appear like take viru serious quarantin turn around allow possibl infect individu pleas silent infect everyon around best tinfoil hat theori come govern activ tri get spread around quickli entir populac becom infect build immun die peopl antibodi start wear hope prevent predict highli deadli second round infect could allow sustain indefinit cours second theori fulli adopt mental bend realiti will make everyth okay say everyth okay realli hope one stock food pretti much accept get infect start wonder invest full hazmat suit type getup second round hit
2045,Humble recommendation.,"For those still looking for n95 masks and have not purchased any or been able to find any. I have seen many partial face respirators available and for sale. Economically and feasibly this may be the best option and here is why. N95s are one time use. Mask gets wet with condensation from your breath and it is garbage. Now admittedly this is a good feature as all you have to do is throw it out and you are good to go. But over a protracted period you will probably need MANY masks. Respirator cartridges are rated for 40hrs or one month of open to air time. Downside is you have to clean the plastic face piece of the mask and attempt to prevent contamination from it but I wouldn’t bother attempting to clean n95 single use masks unless in a pinch. I wouldn’t trust their non-permeability afterwards.

2051,"Forgive my ignorance, but how do I prep long term for cat litter?","I’m afraid  we are gonna have much bigger problems over the next few months but I would really appreciate some ideas on how to prep long term for our cat’s litter box needs.   Was just running the  #’s to see what we still need overall and how much we can afford. Not only am I concerned about the Covid-19 virus itself, but also the breakdown of  worldwide supply chains and the economic impact it will have on us. I have no idea which products will still be accessible in our area so trying to prepare for at least 8 months.   We already have enough cat food but I’m having trouble justifying buying  $600 of cat litter right now when there are much more urgent needs.  

With 2 cats,  we usually go thru about 5-6 boxes of Fresh Step Multi Cat Scoop-able  litter (25 lbs) per month which usually costs us $60-$80 each month.    I’m willing to try cheaper brands or volume discounts but I also don’t want to be self quarantined in a stinky house either.  

The thing is that if we run out of litter and can’t afford or can’t find more,  we won’t be able to keep the cats.   They have always been indoor cats and my daughter (and neighbors) would not be pleased to have outdoor cats.  

I thought we might try to use sand instead of liter and perhaps we might could find it locally.  Although I have no idea how much hundreds of pounds of sand would cost nor how big of a sandbox would we need to keep it in.  I’ve just never considered what I’d do if we run out of litter so I’m at a loss.   We live in a suburban area near a large city, if that matters.

I'm curious about what all the grey area in between that is ... if we start (in the United States) to get a few cases spreading inside the country, which at this point seems almost inevitable, .. what will you do at that point well before it is to the point that you might take your kids out of school ?

I've noticed in myself that I am already starting to take some minor precautions ... not touching hand rails on the escalator, thinking about viruses as I push the elevator button, standing further away from people who appear to be sick in public areas, and not ordering takeout food as much, etc.  At some point I would refuse to buy takeout food at all, start making fewer trips to stores, start wearing a mask, etc .. and I'm curious what kinds of earlier minor precautions you are taking as you make your way through your day at this point.

Once in self quarantine they were not checked in on by the CDC or any other agency 

In California alone there are 6400 people in self quarantine and this was not disclosed to the press until recently 

The local authorities don’t have a way to even test for the virus when other countries have the ability to test 1000s we haven’t even tested 500

b) the tupperware/plastic dish section was nearly empty

Basically, just anything I needed to live for a month indoors because I was expecting....well I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting.

But lately, with all the supply chain issues and widereaching economic effects, that seems far from enough. So far I've stocked up on maybe 3 months of vitamins, medicine, and cleaning supplies, but that still doesn't seem anywhere near enough for all the effects that seem possible.  Anyway, how long are you guys prepping for and what items are your priorities? Is it food?

2067,Share your worst case scenario and what lengths you would go to survive,"Share your worst case scenario and what you would do to survive.


Please extrapolate on some direct experience you have and how it might play out in the coming weeks or months.


When I got out of the military after my 3rd deployment I had several injuries that left me barely able to walk and with a weakened immune system. I set about on a journey of recovery. However before it got better it got worse. Shorty after separating I came down with Singles before 25. It was the worst pain I've ever experienced... beating out torn ligaments, broken bones, concussions, and migraines.


Shingles was followed by a virus that went around my circle of friends that caused severe cramping in the neck. At the VA appointment they said no virus could cause cramping in the neck and were blasé about coming down with shingles. Following the can't sleep can't move so painful and swollen can't tilt my neck virus was a fast acting sinus infection. The kind where it stuffs up the ears and everything sounds like Charlie Brown. The VA said an appointment to get antibiotics would be 3 weeks away.  I was forced to take matters into my own hands. Which I'll tell you about in the rest of the story.


Before NuSARS had a name I started an email thread researching with several veterans about what was actually happening in China.


The research led me to believe that not only was the situation dire but there will be no vaccine produced.


Previous attempts at a SARS vaccine failed due to Antibody-dependent enhancement.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody-dependent_enhancement


In order to produce a vaccine it has to be effective against each serotype. For instance dengue fever has 4-5 serotypes:


https://www.pulsus.com/scholarly-articles/dengue-diagnosis-treatment-and-vaccine-design-are-efforts-hampered-by-multiple-serotypes-and-crossreactivity-with-zika.pdf


This makes it harder to develop a vaccine or immunity with antibodies as you can be infected again by one of the other serotypes basically immediately.


Based on SARS animal studies a reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 could be more severe an initial infection... Targeting the heart, kidneys, and lungs. This could explain the high death counts at ground zero due to infection not building immunity.

Instead I settled on several prophylactics and treatments that may help with Coronavirus SARS-COV-2.


What follows is a fictional scenario where I narrate how that might play out interspersed with direct experience I learned from the real events I just introduced. I'd like you to also share your own narrative of your own story that defends into something along the lines of ""Despite taking every precaution to my worst fear has been realized""


Every night before bed and every morning before heading out to work I had been taking 500mg of bromelian on an empty stomach. 2 hours after a meal or 1 hour before a meal. Bromelian is shown to be a treatment for pneumonia by making mucus in the lungs lining uninhabitable for microbial infection. It has also shown antiviral effects on HIV, Hep-C, and HPV.


Bromelian reduces inflammation and regulates cytokine production which not only reduces inflammation but reduces the risk of cytokine storms associated with the flu and Coronavirus.


I had been taking bromelian twice a day for weeks as a prophylactic due to it's safety to use long-term. When on public transit I wore an N95 mask and carried hand sanitizer. I put my laundry directly into the washer and ran it on the hot setting with vinegar. I had turned up the water temperature on my hot water heater just to be sure. I would have used dettol but it was all sold out and vinegar was better than nothing.


What I didn't do was wear glasses or eye cover. I came down with what I thought was pinkeye. I didn't realize that Coronavirus has a long list of symptoms that can include pinkeye and even rarely diarrhea.


I had a limited supply of what I thought might be effective against Coronavirus and I didn't want to start using it up because it had all already sold out online...


... about this time the just in time delivery system was collapsing and the runs on the groceries were in full tilt. Where TP, cold medicine, cough drops, bread, water, milk, eggs used to sit were bare shelves. I took time off work but didn't increase the dose of bromelian or take anything else.


A few days later I developed a fever and dry cough. I freaked out and threw everything I had down my throat.


The bromelian has to be taken on an empty stomach and I increased my dose to 2x pills 3x times a day.


When I took food I also took every non-prescription antiviral I could find.


Osha root tincture, Aloe Vera juice, Olive leaf extract, Cats Claw


I got better. The fevers broke, nights without sweats and chills. No cough. Nothing. Little did I realize it was the calm before the storm. I stopped taking all the antiviral herbs. After all, they had worked, they could be valuable for barter or trade.


Unfortunately after another week it became apparent I should have kept taking the antivirals. I was hit hard with fever and shortness of breath.


I returned to the antivirals but they didn't seem to turn the tide. In fact I felt worse on them. I had sold all the bromelian already in exchange for TP. After all, the dose I was using wasn't enough for a prophylactic. Perhaps I needed to take it 3 times a day. I had forgotten it would regulate cytokine production and I was now in the middle of a cytokine storm. My body in an attempt to do everything it could to attack the virus was actually causing more inflammation and damage to myself.


I felt horrible it was obvious that this was the end. I could barely breathe. I remembered back to when my immune system was shot. After the military, when I had infection after infection. How did I recover? What did I do?


I had discovered Jim Humble and his book. I was sceptical of what he discovered in Africa when a member of his survey team out hunting for minerals had come down with malaria he claimed that they were days from anywhere. With no medicine and no hope of extract his team member took a large dose of a stabilized oxygen product designed to purify drinking water. It worked. He recovered quickly and Jim Humble sought to figure out why. He found that Sodium Chlorite mixed with a weak acid such as citric acid or vinegar produces Chlorine Dioxide. He Experimented with this and named this MMS the Miracle Mineral Supplement after the discovery of oxidizing healing he found prospecting.


The idea is that the body is designed to handle oxidation and is more equiped with the ability to use antioxidants and to maintain homeostasis and heal from oxidative stress than a parasite, virus, or bacteria.


The red blood cells are designed to carry oxygen and are resistant to it's oxidation. In fact so well that as long as the dose and dilution is not too extreme they will actually pick up and carry a slightly stronger oxidizer. This oxidizer is strong enough to oxidize viruses, bacteria, and parasites that have no reserves of antioxidants. This clears the blood of sepsis and the oxidizer eventually makes its way anywhere the blood goes.


I purchased some of this stuff after the shingles. I mean, after the pain of shingles you'd look at any options available too. Believe me. It's that bad.


It sat unused while I pleaded with the VA that something was wrong because I had shingles and now myself and 4 others had slowly caught a stiff neck from one another so bad they couldn't sleep or tilt our necks. 


This stuff sat unused, untill I had a sinus infection that the VA couldn't see me for, until 3 weeks had passed.


It was disgusting. I choked out yellow green mucus in the shower. My nose was stuffed. My ears clogging up. I felt my head swimming in bacteria. As my second ear closed up and I could barely hear... Then I remembered the MMS...


I figured, one dose won't kill me. So I mixed up 10 drops of Sodium Chlorite and 10 drops of citric acid. The standard dose at the time (now 2 drops each every 2 hours) to produce Chlorine Dioxide.


I slammed it back in a shot glass full of water and chased it with 3 standard cups of water.


Within 5 minutes I felt something. Sort of an invigoration. Within 10 minutes I felt like the pressure in my head was easing. Within an hour I could hear again in both ears. I took my next dose 8 hours later and the next day it was like I had never been sick at all.


I never went back to the VA. I started taking this stuff at the first sign of the sniffles. At my peak I could take 30 drops and feel no ill effects and go exercise. I was convinced I was burning everything out of my body that couldn't repair itself. I went hard. I did all the physiotherapy and exercises to heal my torn ligaments and regained balance and ability to walk again unassisted.

Eventually didn't really need it and stopped taking it for several years. But you'd be damned sure I would take it if I felt burning a novel Coronavirus out was better than dying from a cytokine storm in my 30s. Am I suggesting you burn autism out of kids with a dangerous oxidizer? Fuck No! A last resort? Yes.

2071,Holistic/Frugal Preps,"Hello all. I just wanted to put together some natural/frugal preps you may not have considered. Many of these things I have or use on a frequent basis in every day life and I believe could be helpful alternative preps for many. I hope this helps some of you who may want to prep but find traditional methods impractical for you. As always, take any advice with a grain of salt and do your own research to find the best fit for your family. 

• MEDICINAL 

Peppermint, Rosemary, Lemon Balm, and Dandelion are all herbs that have tested and shown to be effective anti virals against things such as HIV, Hepatitis, Herpes, and even Dengue. I can post links to published studies if you’d like in the comments below. 
Some ideas for prep would be to grow a window box of these herbs for yourself as well as obtain dried teas for consumption. 

Manuka Honey has been shown to have excellent antibiotic, showing to be even more effective against MRSA than antibiotics. Anecdotally, I suffer from a condition that causes skin lesions and boils and have successfully used Manuka honey post I/D on a boil that was infected with MRSA. This infection had caused a recurring boil due to MRSA, as three prior rounds of antibiotics and I/D did not manage to kill the infection. Manuka is commonly known as the “tea tree oil” plant.

• HOUSEHOLD ITEMS  

Rather than stock piling wasteful single use paper items, consider using cloth. You can easily find bulk cloth wipes for toilet use at affordable rates or make your own from your preferred fabric choice. A PUL lined zippered bag for storing used cloth can be washed along with wipes. For those with children I recommend cloth diapers - the benefits of these being it is impractical to stockpile for an unforeseen extension of production/manufacturing (such as 6+ months). For disinfecting washes: you can use hydrogen peroxide, bleach, or Grape Seed Extract oil. Just remember to wash the soiled laundry prior to a disinfecting round. The sun is also a great natural disinfectant and also a wonderful natural solution for bleaching stains out.

Paper towels can also easily be replaced by kitchen towels/cleaning rags. For those who use Swiffer type disposable products I recommend checking your automotive section of a local department store (Walmart, Target, etc) for a bundle pack of microfiber cleaning rags. These fit really well and can be reused many times over for either mopping or sweeping. Instead of wasting space stockpiling disposable goods, you can easily have a permanent stash to use again and again.

For soaps/cleaners I highly recommend Dr Bronners liquid soaps in 32oz bottles. They are biodegradable which is important if you no longer have access to public utility functions. (There’s also a natural peppermint version.) They can be used as body wash, shampoo, dish soap, etc. To extend the use of any soaps (and how I use Dr Bronners) dilute 1:10 parts water in a reusable foaming soap dispenser. Dilute 1:30 for floor cleaning. 
I recommend Zote bar soap for laundry as it is long lasting, cheap, and biodegradable. If electricity is cut off, you can hand wash in a tub or a bucket. See below ;)

*Get a fucking BUCKET. * Yes, you heard me. A bucket. Know what they’re great for? Everything. You can carry things in them. You can use a rope and haul items up and down multiple floors or whatever. It can become a temporary toilet. It can be used to clean laundry. It can be turned upside down and used as a step stool or a seat. Seriously, just get a few buckets. They’re like $2-$4. Buckets for everybody!

I also recommend obtaining a drying rack for laundry. If electricity is out, you won’t have to worry about having clean clothing. There are many affordable options and I find they’re much more space saving than clothesline, and laundry won’t be exposed to potentially contaminated air outdoors if you are in an urban area.

• WATER

Instead of purchasing giant packs of disposable water bottles, or even gallon water - get a couple 6-7gal water jugs. I camp with these because we often camp on BLM lands/camp sites without amenities and they are handy dandy when you need to pack in all your supplies. You can easily fill them up at a refill station or from your tap if you have a reliable tap. 

I also highly recommend obtaining a Sawyer water filter (or a similar product) because it means you will rely less on a massive stash of water in an emergency. It also doesn’t make your water taste disgusting like the water tabs, and it filters out any debris. Sawyer brand also makes a Zero Point Two filter that is capable of filtering viruses and not just bacteria. 

• Emergency supplies
 
Make sure you have a sufficient first aid kit. Butterfly bandages are a great alternative to stitches if the healthcare system is overwhelmed and you want to avoid virus exposure. Stop buying a ridiculous amount of matches, which most of you will never use. A few cheap LED lanterns can last for a long time for lighting purposes and a refillable lighter with some extra fuel makes more sense for fire starting. Save your dryer lint and cardboard/paperboard as a nice homemade fire starter. I highly recommend a battery bank and a small solar panel for recharging cell phone/batteries. I have an old Anker battery that’s been going strong for 6+ years and it’s been invaluable. Go ahead and download some of your favorite shows and books for offline use in advance if you prefer digital media. One of the common things people don’t plan for is boredom. 

Download maps for offline use. Google Maps offers this as well as a few other paid options as well. I like to download both satellite and road views so I can find water when I need it or can prepare for route finding. 

Stove and fuel: I prefer to use cans of butane and a cheap backpacking stove. I had the same stove for 7 years with extensive use and it only cost $15, it conserved fuel use as well and only recently had to be replaced. Many people prefer other propane models and that’s fine they can just be pricey.

• FOOD

Don’t stockpile things you know you won’t eat. Stick with things you actually know how to use and cook. Many people talk about beans but depending what you buy they can take a hell of a long time to cook. For many people it’s actually a great time to start seeds! If you don’t have a yard, a balcony or window garden will work great. I recommend herbs like sage, basil, thyme, mint, peppers and tomatoes, and other easy to grow plants. You’ll be grateful for the fresh food with all those dry goods you’ve stocked up! And no need to risk exposing yourself to a grocery store only to find empty shelves. I also recommend getting a friendly aloe plant because they’re great for cuts, scrapes, and burns. Print out or download canning tips and mason jars are fairly affordable and are a great way to preserve any of the fresh food you’ve grown after the season is over if stores are still empty.


• PPE:

Goggles are affordable, easy to disinfect and can be found almost anywhere including your local Dollar Tree. Shower caps can also easily be disinfected and can be used many times to protect your hair and even to cover shoes. I recommend not wearing any shoes indoors at all. Slippers/sandals are a great indoor shoe.  Latex gloves can also be disinfected and reused many times. If you do not have access to masks, a bandana or homemade mask option is a good alternative at least to keep you from touching your face. I recommend if things become dire, keep a bucket(!) of disinfecting solution by the front door to rinse all items in and they can be brought in and laid on a wire rack to dry

People need to eat. No pandemic has “ended the world” in the past... I’m looking for practical advice for an individual/family to prep and be of value in such a world. 

For example, every economic depression certain businesses suffer while others thrive. If you feel we are headed into one you could prep by either pivoting what your business does or preparing for certain scenarios. 

I’m not sure if I’m articulating myself clearly... but I just don’t buy into a “Walking Dead” type of end game here... more like functioning under wartime conditions... but instead of bombs and bullets... it’s disease. 

You can stockpile all you want but at some point you need to contribute, trade and cooperate with society and not just live in a hole in the ground. 

 Can we get some discussion going around what we can do or provide to keep ourselves employed or valuable and have a means to barter in a global pandemic scenario?

2076,Prepping for low budget,"Hi

Not everyone has a bunker in the woods. Most of us live probably in a city renting a small flat. This guide is based for people who aren't necessarily into prepping, are on a low budget and don't have a lot of time.

Believe it or not but prepping can save you money (sometimes a lot) and be integrated into your daily life. It's often too late to prepare right before disaster stricks. Prepping should be part of your day to day business.

It's also very important to rotate and eat your emergency stockpile in your daily life (many preppers and guide forget about this) 

For three reasons:
* you don't waste food
* you don't waste your money and time 
* you will know how to prepare food based on your emergency supplies. When disaster strikes, you won't be in unfamiliar territory. Simply doing what you already do on a daily basis. During emergencies it's a relief to not be completely disoriented. 

The information contained in this guide is provided for informational purposes only. I cannot be held responsible for your actions.

1) Water

Rule of thumb: 1 gallon of water per person in your household for 5 days.

Water is one of the most important aspect during crisis time. The easiest and cheapest way is to simply stockpile a bunch of water bottle. You can rotate them every 6 months or so (drink them or use them for coffee, cooking etc. Soda are not healthy (drinking water everyday is a good general advice) and not versatile (you can't really cook or clean surfaces with soda and other sweet drinks).

Why not using a water tank? 
While water tanks can hold more water, you need to make sure the water inside stays clean (algee and fungy can quickly grow and can render it unsafe). 

1.1) while not strictly water, its always useful to have 
Tea
Herbal tea
Instant coffe
Those can help and provide comfort during hard times.

2) Food

Food is equally important.

2.2) dried food
Dried food is easy to store of course depending on your preference you might want different dry food (only stockpile things you know you will eat because you will have to rotate them to not loose your food and your money this also insure your stockpile is always ready and fresh). Make sure to choose what you know you like and eat in your household. As an example:

As a starting point:
Rice
Sugar
Flour
Pasta
Lentils
Dried fruits
Cereals
Etc

If you want to go further:
Almond
Chestnuts
Dried mushrooms
Instant noodle if you like
Raisins
Chocolate powder for instant chocolate
Etc

Do not store dried food in bags or cardbox, because bugs could get inside and trust me you don't want to see your emergency food rotten by worms.

Hermetic reusable glass jars are amazing. First they will protect the food from bugs and other insects. They are transparent so by just looking at the shelf you will know how much is left and you can easily sterilize them. They can last a lifetime so it's a great investment. Buy two medium sized jar for each dry food item you want to store. Why two medium? First it's easier to move them around (imagine moving a big rice jar) and when one is finished, let's say the rice one you can clean it and put it on a special shelf. At your next grocery shopping you will know what you need to buy (in this case rice). Not only you will never run out of stuff with this system but you can also save money by waiting when the food is on sale (I told you that prepping can save money on the long run).

2.3) canned food
While it's possible to do your own canned food it's not recommended because if you don't know what you are doing it can create unsanitary conditions.

Industrial canned food can last a long time.

Tuna
Tomate soup
Spam
Beans
Various canned vegetables
Fruit jam and marmelades
Etc

Again similar to dried food make sure you are doing rotations. Buy in sales to save money and replenish your stockpile.

2.3) Ready to eat food

You might not have access to a hot stove (no electricity or gas). It's always good to have ready to eat food like:
Beef jerky
Snacks
Chocolate
Dried meat

3) medications

I'm not a doctor and please always go first to a doctor to make sure you are not making things worse.

3.1) over the counter medication

It's always good to have some of those at home
Bandage
Aspirin
Paracetamol
Alcohol
Hand cleaner / sanitizer 
Vitamins

3.2) if you have an existing illness (diabetes, severe allergic reactions etc)
Make sure you have enough prescription drugs you need for at least 2 months. You never know if something goes wrong with the supply chain.

3.3) cleaning and medical supplies 

Face Masks
Protection glass
Disposable gloves
Condoms
Soap 
Bleach
Vinegar

4) general useful items

Those items can help you during hard time

Battery powered radio (internet might be disrupted)
Flashlight
A few batteries for the flashlight and radio
Candles (be careful to not start a fire)
Camping gas stove and 3 additional gas canister 
lighter, matches
2 rolls of Ducktape
If you have the money, a small solar panel with battery and USB charger for your phone. Can be installed on your balcony. 
A few board game (don't underestimate a lengthy boring quarantine and your smartphone or computer might not work if the electrical network is disrupted

5) conclusion
As you can see prepping can be quite easy and save you money on the long run especially with the dried food storage. The key is to start it and progressively build up. Don't forget to rotate your food and use from time to time your emergency gas stove to cook to make sure to know how to use it.

Make sure to label containers, food jars and shelf so you can easily find stuff when needed

2077,Real Talk: Quarantine,"Now that it's here, let us all say it outloud. What would you do?

Situation: Cities are evacuating.  A few of your closest friends and relatives left the day before and are arriving the next afternoon. What do you do with them? Quarantine them on your land while providing food and water? Turn them away? 

One week later, more friends and family finally made it. Bob has an RV. Three months ago you invited Bob to bring it to your house for shelter/quarantine space. He didn't. Now he wishes he had. 

Four people are infected upon arrival. Three die.

2078,"If you’re getting out of dodge, I’m curious on the signs you’re looking for","I live in a major metropolitan east coast city, and have a bug out plan with my mother in law who lives a ways out of the city on a couple of acres with a stream. It’s a nice quiet place, and she’s got a couple of extra bedrooms and more than enough space for us to crash comfortably. I’ve established a criteria for when we start heading out, and I’m interested to compare with others their telltale signs that it’s time to go. Here’s my following criteria as it stands. It takes one of these conditions for me to head on out:

1.) NYC has 25 cases, that means it’s on my doorstep
2.) My city has 10 cases
3.) When I think we’re on the verge of panic buying. 

In regards to panic buying, I’ve been going to Costco weekly at this point, and looking at their stock levels. Since Costco doesn’t warehouse, and holds their stock in store, it feels like a good gauge to me in regards to the overall supply chain health. I’m confident in my stipulations, but am curious what others are thinking is the “tipping point.”

2080,Now is the time for us to take the lead to help others.,"So I've been thinking and doing some searching, and here's what I've concluded:

- Different government/organization/website has different COVID-19 guidelines &amp; pandemic preparedness resources available. Some are comprehensive, some are basic, some are updated daily, some don't even have it at all.

- The COVID-19 guidelines &amp; pandemic preparedness resources are not all available in many languages. Especially in countries which are at the highest risks.

- There's still a very few COVID-19 guidelines &amp; pandemic preparedness resources that are easy to understand, appealing, full of pictures and colors, has a great visualization and design, etc. like an infographics, pamphlets, educational video, pocketbook, etc.

From what I've seen and heard here and there, we can't fully rely or even trust on the government on this. Now, the *window of opportunity* is already closed for some countries. And I think this is the time for us to take the lead to help others. I think one less person uneducated and unprepared is one less person away whom will makes things much worse.

So I'm inviting you to make, create, compile, or just share the needed resources together and share it with others. Our loved ones, friends, families, anyone. I think we don't have to be a pro at graphic designs or a WHO spokeperson to be able to do this.

2092,Rehydrate Evaporated Milk!,"I just sitting here with a cup of milk and thinking about preps when I remembered how I ""made"" milk when I was in the Philippines living more than a decade ago. 

Evaporated Milk is milk where 60% of the water has been removed. Online sources will tell you to just mix it half and half. But more research and simple calculations showed there is a better way. 

Take a quart mason jar, dump a can of evaporated milk in it. Pour filtered water until it's full. Take a tablespoon of condensed milk and put it in it. Put a lid on it and shake it real good. Put in the fridge and it's a pretty tasty milk. While not as good as fresh milk, it's a heck of a lot better than UHT milk and it's cheaper. You can get cans of evap milk for under a $1 putting the per gallon price at less than $4. 

Anyways, my family drank this for a year and we all thought it tasted better than the UHT milk or powdered milk that we could buy...and it was cheaper.

I hope that someone in need will find this useful. 

There's a lot I still need to work on but there just isn't enough hours in day.

**Things I am working on:**

1. Prescription medication interactions. There are too many possibilities here but I'll figure something out. If you're on many prescription medications, call your pharmacy before getting anything in case there's an interaction. 
2.  It can't list multiple combos for the same symptoms. This is a bug that I'll be fixing tonight.   

3. Sign up is required for the OTC recommendation function. I'll be changing this in the coming week (It requires rewriting some code).

2110,Make a rotating menu.,"If you recall there is an old commercial, Wednesday is Prince Spaghetti Day. We also have Taco Tuesday. Many families enjoy pizza on Fridays. 

If you are buying ahead, it is good to count up your meals and plan them out. It will let you realize you might need more taco shells. You might need more sauce to go with your pasta. Making a meal plan also helps avoid having the same thing every day or running out of a key component. 

Post it where you can see it. Just like the school lunch menus that are made monthly. This also helps if like many (including me) money is a factor. I know I will have to get eight meals of black bean burgers into my family but if I can plan them so pizza is the next day, it can help with the griping. Black bean burgers are not a huge favorite at my house but they have the huge benefit of being shelf stable til I need them, unlike frozen food, which is reliant on electricity. But I can definitely imagine putting off the collective groans of my children in favor of the cheers I get when I announce dinner is chicken nuggets. And then ending up with a week straight of black bean burgers.

2114,We are definitely in the next stage of prepping,"I think of things in simple 3s and look at prepping in three stages.

1st Stage: Early stage buying when just a few people even know what is going on. Supplies are plentiful at regular prices. If you are buying at this stage you are the crazy conspiracy guy. 

2nd Stage: A sizable number of people see the problem and start buying stuff they need. Generally stuff is available but there are shortages for some things. If you are buying at this stage, you look prudent to some and overly cautious to others. 

3rd Stage: Everyone and their momma recognize they need to be buying their supplies. Many products sell out at these stages. It’s like the night before a hurricane. If you are just doing your buying at this stage then good luck.

I was buying my masks and supplies back on the 23rd and 24th when I still could. I bought my masks and goggles at Walmart at regular prices. I stocked up quite a bit thinking that while the chance of there being an issue with the virus in the US was small. I’ve bought a little more every few days knowing that the chance is increasing. 

I think people in the US are waking up today to the fact that things could get out hand quickly. The stock market is falling. I expect that at any time we could quickly transition from 2nd to 3rd stage.

2115,Homemade masks,"Hey! 

So, I was trying to figure out our mask situation. My husband has respirators and such for work- so he will be fine. Our local stock was wiped EARLY. Like before china locked down early and to no luck. We are in ""hey, I'm fucked but I can google, I can still get out. Problem solve"" 

But god forbid I need to take a child out I need something to offer them *some* protection. They range from infant to late elementary school age. 

So I was trying to find data on the efficiency of homemade masks. Also I'm kinda hoping that masks become more socially acceptable with this thing. 

So I was thinking of making something like this: 
https://mustsharenews.com/cloth-face-mask/

And using air filters (the ones that are the equivalent of n95 or better) as inserts. If we run out of that because the world is ending I have a never ending supply of old clothes with plenty of cotton t-shirts. 

Obviously I've seen the studies on google about this, so this is a ""worst case scenario"" issue. I was hoping to find masks by now but to no avail. I've been preparing with my younger two in tow and I feel my window to prep is closing.

* DO NOT store all flammable liquids together. Gas canisters, alcohol bottles can be a dangerous hazard.

2147,Home security prep - should I be thinking about plywood?,"I never thought I would be asking such a question in all my life, but here goes...  


I am pretty well prepped and live alone. However, there is no way my employer will be having us work from home unless it's government mandate (even though we absolutely could - some do sometimes, but that's just execs).   


I live and work in a small Midwestern USA town. I have two different indoor/outdoor camera systems that send me alerts, plus a formal home security system. We have a great police force (city and county are based here) that comes in droves in minutes in an emergency.

All that said, if things start to get really bad, should I be thinking about putting plywood on my less-publicly-visible windows? Like low-key from the inside? Luckily, there is no trim and it's the original windows, so it's not like I'd be ruining things (the windows were an upcoming project that has been delayed). I do also have several sets of bars/grills that are meant to be placed on the inside that I used while I rented a place in a less than savory neighborhood.  


Anyway  - can't believe I'm asking such a thing, but it's a genuine concern. I don't know what the prepper community consensus is on such a thing, so I am asking for your advice.

2148,I am 12yrs old. And my mother is refusing to buy masks or prepare well,"I am a 12 yr old egyptian boy living in mansoura. A big travel hub here in egypt. I kept following the news on reddit since January and urging my mom to prepare. And she would refuse. I told her to buy n95 masks. She went to a pharmacy, asked for them, and bought 4, yeah you heared that right only 4. and she kept buying cheap surgical masks, and no n95 masks. Ok fine. Nothing happened here in Egypt yet so I guessed fine. Then Iran happened I kept scaring my mom with exaggerated needs there. And she said she will prepare. Ok. Finally. 

#The_Preparations:

She told me to write a list of things I find on the internet and things we need and things I thought we needed because I am the man of the house. Fine. I wrote a big list and didn't study nor prepare for the lesson I was gonna give in front of the school principle, nor do my homework. I write a big list of things, ranked them, color coded them, write advice on things I list. While writing she tells me we will go to the supermarket. 

#The_supermarket:

I take my big list and pen to mark bought things. while going out of the car she says:you can't take that with you, you will look like an asker(upper class slang for someone who is poorly behaved and poor) I say it will be useful, she explodes at me, and when she does that I will either get beat or singled out in the car or punished home. And if nothing happens she will be aggressive the whole go.looks like we will go shopping with mo list.I say fine. I pull up my phone which has a smaller list at least to help. So I look. I see shampoo which is in a far aisle so I tell mom that I will go get shampoo. I go looking for strong shampoo instead of baby shampoo which is the main shampoo used in our house(no matter how much I protest) she explodes at me and tells me to return it, I tell her it is inexpensive, and before I tell her the price she shouts my name loudly and my sister looks at me angerly for angring mom. So I return them. nothing really happened the rest of the trip till we were in the shampoo aisle, she looks at the baby shampoo and finds it 64 egyptian pounds(a lot) I tell her the ones I picked for her were better she looks aggressively at me and before she spoke I told her they were 40pounds a piece and her face became confused. So show her where they are and she finds them, likes them and picks two which she liked. Of the type I brought her earlier. I stood stumped. 

#The_return:

We go back home and I talk about masks and that we need them and she tells me that they don't do anything and that if you double up two surgical masks opposite each other they will protect you, all this she heard from facebook and refuses to buy more than the 4(n95) masks she bought I tell her that n95 is better and that doublimg surgical won't do anything more. She doesn't believe me. And says that""if masks don't protect you but protect others from you, that means the don't let particles out but let them in so if you double stack reversed ones you will be protected""I mean, you really can't argue with stupid can you? And she told me I have money saved up. Why don't I buy masks for myself from them? I told her there is no point in that if the whole house doesn't wear too. She and my sister started rambling about how n95 masks are expensive and that you only need them outside. And she told me she will buy those cheap n95 masks she found at that pharmacy for 20 pounds a piece, that is almost one dollar per piece instead of the original ones which are 90 pounds(6 dollars) .and they don't have 3m printed on them. she will buy 10 and buy 100 pounds worth of surgical masks and kept rambling about how she was trying to tell me that she couldn't buy them subtly but I didn't catch it. 

#The_finale

So now I am asking you, do counterfeit n95 masks work? Would it be worth it to spend some of my money which I saved on masks? I could buy 3 with half of my money. Also, there is a 45pound(3 dollar)""n95"" Mask in my pharmacy but they are apparently made in China instead of America so they're cheaper, how about those, and are they scamming me? Is it possible to diy a mask? 

Tbh I just feel like doing everything possible to get infected, just so I can die and make her unable to sleep again or recover after she spends all her life savings on treatment, I know that if you recover you get immunity which means I wouldn't have to worry again, unlike her who will be afraid of my siblings getting sick and do everything I told her she would need to do.

**protection**:

N95 masks, filters over 99% of virus. 2$/mask. durability unknown. use swimming goggles or airtight goggles.

half-face respirator masks. about 30$. use swimming goggles for eye protections, as tehy are too bulky to accomodate airtight goggles.

full facepiece respirator. the most expensive but the best coverage and comfort.

full body painting suit (optional) 10$

a box of nitrile glove. 5$ for a box of 20

disinfectant (bleach, hand sanitizer atleast 70% alcohol).

**food**: 7kg of dried rice per month. 7kg of dried beans per month. Unflavored protein powder (google which has the less disgusting taste). Any cans, dried food, unperishable foods.

**Medication and hygiene:

Stock up on whatever medication i cannot go without. I can't leave the house for months so get enough toothpaste, soap, etc. Get enough ant and fly baits. 

**doomsday scenarios**

2157,Chloroquine Prep Guide,"I came across an interesting clip and article today. According to [Dr. Didier Raoult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Raoult), chloroquine is  an effective tool in the treatment to the new coronavirus. Source: [youtube clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L6ehRif-v8) (French) and [article](https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/a-made-in-canada-solution-to-the-coronavirus-outbreak/)

Here's the transcript in French (I skipped a bit of fluff):

&gt;Très bien, un scoop de dernière minute, une nouvelle très importante, les Chinois qui vont le plus vite, qui sont les plus pragmatiques plutôt que de chercher un vaccin ou une molécule qui soigne le coronavirus\[...\]  
&gt;  
&gt;On teste les molécules qui sont anciennes, qui sont connues et qui sont sans problème de toxicité pour les tester contre le nouveau virus. Ils ont trouvé, comme c'était le cas pour le SARS et oublié, que sur covid-19 la chloroquine est active in vitro. Les Chinois sont les meilleurs en virologie au monde et viennent tout juste de sortir une première étude de la chloroquine sur le coronavirus. C'est donc efficace sur le coronavirus avec 500mg de chloroquine par jours pendant 10 jours. Il y a une amélioration spectaculaire et c'est recommandé pour tous les cas cliniquement positifs d'infection au coronavirus chinois. Donc c'est une excellente nouvelle et c'est probablement l'infection respiratoire la plus facile à traiter de tous  et donc ce n'est pas la peine de s'exciter. Il faut travailler pour voir les molécules potentielles qui sont immédiatement disponibles sur le marché. Faites attention, car il n'y aura plus de chloroquine dans les pharmacies bientôt.

I'll translate the most important parts only:

&gt;He says that the Chinese are the best in the world in virology. They have found that chloroquine is active in vitro (in covid-19) as it was also the case for SARS and then forgotten about. The Chinese published the first study very recently about the effectiveness of chloroquine on the new coronavirus. It has been found to be effective on the new coronavirus with 500mg of chloroquine per day for 10 days. There is a spectacular improvement and it is recommended for all positive infected clinical cases. It is very good news and it is most likely the easiest respiratory infection to treat so there's no point to get worked up. We need to work to see which potential molecules are immediately available on the market. ***Be careful because chloroquine won't be available in drugstores much longer (as in it will be sold out).***

Chloroquine in the USA/Canada requires a prescription however you can find 99% pure chloroquine phosphate on eBay that is technically for acquarium use but I can't see why it wouldn't be effective.  I've contacted the sellers and they are indeed getting swarmed with orders due to the coronavirus so take it as you wish.

I would recommend buying emtpy gel capsules (size ""0"" should fit roughly 500mg per) and fill them up yourself. All you need is 500mg x 10 = 5000mg = 5 grams for 1 ""treatment"".  You could buy a high precision scale on amazon to make sure of the exact dosage for each capsule.

2160,Know how to cook your dried beans!,"Everyone who is getting dried beans who has never cooked dried beans before should be aware that many dried beans need to either soak overnight (with throwing away the water) or have a ""quick soak after boiling"" . This is especially true if using a slow cooker. The concern is a natural poisonous chemical called Phytohaemagglutinin which requires soaking or quick soak after boiling to get rid of the poison. This is especially true for red kidney beans.

Check out links like this for more info or web search for Phytohaemagglutinin and beans

Really make sure you are cooking your beans correctly as to not get very sick.

2165,Looking for some support on whether we should leave Los Angeles now before it's too late,"Hey Everyone! I am new to this subreddit but I super appreciate all of the support you all are willing to offer in the comments. 

My boyfriend and I live in Los Angeles, California. Actually right in the thick of it right outside of Downtown. Our immediate area isn't as crowded but we are still very close to homeless populations and completely locked in by buildings around us. 

My family is out in Florida and his is out in Australia so we are here all alone outside of immediate friends. Without the family support and seeing the this virus starting to really ramp up we are having serious discussions on whether we should leave L.A. for a undetermined amount of time before things get locked down and it is too late for us to be closer to family. Great things is both of us can work from anywhere and our jobs are not determined by any supply chain that would be directly impacted by China's supply chain breaking down. The only thing that might make things difficult is people willing to spend money as things start to get worse. But I am a health coach so I can offer lots of support with clients and keep a thriving business from the natural standpoint and he is a musician with lots of residual income that sustains him.

My question is posed to you all what you would do in our situation and when would you feel it would be the last warning signs to make this kind of decision?

As we started seriously talking about this today, both of us don't want to make the wrong decision here. Here are the options we are toying with. We would love to input, suggestions and any advice as we are both feeling quite overwhelmed on what to do here:

1. We stay in L.A. in our apartment near downtown. We keep stocking up and just hunker down when the time comes. Here we have access to a gym, a pool, sun and places within our building that will help us from going stir crazy at the very least.
2. We go to Florida to stay with my family. Out there we have a pretty big family that can offer lots of support and help.
3. We go out to Australia to be close to his family and friends. Out there we have a place to stay that is out near nature and away from lots of people giving us a much better chance of quarantining ourselves potentially.

#2 Rice.  Costco, Winco, Amazon what ever.  Pack it in gallon bags with o2 absorbers.  It's cheap. Buy the rice you like to eat.  Jasmine, batsmati, short grain or a mix of all of them.  Brown rice is not appropriate for long term storage.  Only good for a year in mylar with O2 absorbers.  Know how to cook it.  A rice cooker is best.  Pressure cookers are second best. Stovetop is ok (but likely to burn it).  If you hate rice or don't know how to cook it don't store it. Good for 20+ years in mylar with o2 absorbers.

#3 Beans. Black beans, kidney beans, pinto beans, white beans, garbanzo beans and a half dozen others.  Know how to soak and cook them (pressure cooker is your friend). Available in. 25-50 pound bags.  Know how you like to spice them.  Good for 20+ years in mylar with o2 absorbers.

#4 Salt and sugar.  Store in mylar bags without O2 absorbers.  Good forever.  Get more than you think you could possibly need.  They are cheap right now but salt and sugar are hard to come by in Minnesota.

#5 Noodles/pasta can be stored in mylar but shelf life might only be 10 ish years.  Sharp pasta is more likely to puncture mylar.  I absolutely love Barilla protein plus pasta but for long term storage you want plain white.

#6  Freeze dried #10 tins of whatever.  Great to have.  Pay attention to expiration dates.  Try things from your stores if you keep them past their expiration date to see if you notice a difference.

#7 Spices. Food is better with flavor whole spices last longer than ground.  Know what grows in your area.  Seeds to grow your own are best.  Oxygen absorbers kill seeds.

#8 chemicals.  Bleach from a bottle has a limited shelf life. (6-12months) know how to make liquid bleach from pool shock (calcium hypochlorite). Know how to purify water with it.

#9 The most important part of prepping is knowing where stuff comes from and how it is made.  In a disaster situation I am not going to see an orange or banana for a very long time.

Just curious how all of your are preparing mentally for potential quarantine situations. I live in an apartment with my boyfriend and trying to make sure we both have space so we don't get on each other's nerves. 

I deal with issues of anxiety so wrapping my head around this whole pandemic has been a bit of a struggle.

2184,Bugging Out of Major city for Coronavirus?,"Current situation: College student living in Philadelphia, PA. Been reading about the coronavirus for over a month now and it's come to the point where I think it's likely we'll face some kind of quarantines here in my city of Philadelphia sometime soon in the next month or two. My school has a tremendous amount of professors and students who travel internationally regularly, so I think my area will be an especially bad community outbreak location for the virus. I also know that almost none of the people around me are prepared, which could likely cause great problems in the event of an even minor SHTF scenario. 

Currently, I'm living in a highly dense apartment complex with one roommate. I've prepped about one months supply of food, water, and PPE for me and my roommate, spending most of extra savings along the way.  Unfortunately, my roommate told his girlfriend about my preps, who then told her sister who she lives with. Now, I've got at least four, if not more, mouths to feed here in the event of a crisis, and although they refuse to prep for themselves (they think it's ""paranoid""), I know they will come to me in the event of an issue, and because of my limited resources, I can't really prepare for them all singlehandedly (I'd only have enough food for like 10 days if they all showed up, and I'd have a hard time turning them away). 

Anyways, my current decision: my grandma lives by herself about an hour a way in the outskirts of a small suburban town. If things start to look bad in Philadelphia in the next couple of weeks, do you think it makes sense to take most of my preps and bug out to my grandma's place? If so, when do you think would be the time that makes sense?

I could go in depth on how I made it but I’m time constrained and I see people really prepping with water. With my filter, I’m not concerned about how much water I keep stored because it filters everything. 

I found a video by searching on YouTube with an idea of how to make one even cheaper. It uses a couple of 5 gallon buckets, a spigot and 4 filters. That’s overkill. You really only need one filter, it just goes slower. You can filter about 2 gallons or so a day from each filter element. Two candle filter elements will set you back $40. four buckets with lids is probably $25 to $30 and two spigot maybe $15. Less than $90 all in, you can have two water filters pushing out a total of 4 gallons per day of quality drinking water.

2197,I'm not convinced I need to. Why do you prep?,"First - I am genuinely asking and trying to understand all of the following with all due respect. If you respond in a disrespectful manner I'll discredit you and assume you're crazy because you can't have a civilized discussion about this. I'll be honest and state my views in the way I would to my best friends. I think that's the most genuine. Please don't read any of this as sarcasm or the like. Because it's not. It's pure curiosity.

Right. So, why are you prepping? To me it seems a little bit extreme. In fact, I kind of chuckle every time I see a post on prepping. I'm very much aware of the current events in the world, and I am aware of how people react when supplies are ""scarce."" I'm probably a little more informed than the average person in my region and I don't see society collapsing any time soon.  Do you? Or am I way over analysing why you're doing this? You can be honest.

I don't see the point. Why change the way I live? 

Generally speaking I'm not in a city with hundreds of thousands of people. I always have enough food to last a few weeks anyway. If things were to get as bad as I imagine you think it's going to get, I know how to hunt for food and I know how to grow food. I'm not worried at all about a quarantine, the virus, or any of it. 

Help me explore and understand the idea. Why should I fill a closet with months of supplies? It would be neat to have viewpoints from people with families and those without families to provide for. I probably understand why those with families do it more than those without.

2201,Tips for end-goal of prep plan?,"Hi all :) 
I've been following COVID since early January, and with all the stuff going down in Italy, even we in the US ""valley of the clueless"" are starting to take caution.

My suburb/boro/etc is fairly loosely spaced; it's not too hard to move relatively undetected (if you're willing to slog through creeks and tunnels like you're in a Metro game 😂).
My plan in this case is to spend a day consolidating supplies and maybe procure a weapon if things are reallyyy lawless enough (there's been a partially built Sten in my workbench for a while), and make my way through a largely forested area via said waterways and tunnels to the neighboring boro, where my SO and larger tracts of open-ish land are.

2207,HOW TO MINIMIZE EXPOSURE TO VIRUSES AND OTHER HELPFUL TIPS TO SURVIVE,"Hi everyone. I would like to share some tips and advice on how to calmly deal with the coronavirus problem, to minimize the chances of getting sick and possibly spreading it. These are tips that the Italian ministry of health has never released, not because they are ineffective, but because their application requires a certain rigor and constant vigilance. They are are more complicated than ""*wash your hands with soap frequently*"". And they can be applied to any citizen facing an imminent pandemic.

I am not a doctor, but I have good knowledge in the field. I'm not even a prepper, but I like reading.

I would not talk on the criticality of the moment, on the tediousness of the topic, on the dangerousness of the virus, on the need (or not) to adopt these preventive measures and any other aspect that is not purely practical. I do not mention the sources, nor the links where to find the material, but a quick look on the internet will confirm them. **I will not go into many explanations, it is up to you to search the implementation of my advices**, which are aimed at those who are seriously worried, those who cannot afford to get sick, or who will be in contact with infected subjects. 

Following the below rules made me avoid any seasonal flu in the last 15 years, despite my work at close contact with many people and my shitty immune system.

English is not my first language, so be patient. Measurements units are metric. Prices are in euro. Names might be different in your country (N95 is FF P2 in Italy). If you have suggestion or better written form for my sentences, PM me and I will update this post.

Buckle up, this is a very long post. 

&amp;#x200B;

**MASKS**

N95 and P100 masks are now globally unavailable, so it is useless to search. 

Remember that they last 5 hours (version without valve) or at most 8 hours (version with valve). Then they should be thrown away. If you've been wearing the mask for less than 5 hours and it's wet and moist, wear a new one.

Half face / full face masks with interchangeable filters are still available and have fair prices. They are safer than the disposable version, they tolerate a little beard and the filters last a few days. You can found them on amazon or in any hardware store / DIY store / color factory /Home depot. 

You don't need  *vapor* or *gas* filters. Just a particulate filter P3 R will be good. P3 R have a negligible cost (not on Amazon though). The more powerful is the filter, the more easily it becomes saturated and the more difficult it is to breathe. 

I repeat: the P3Rs are fine and correspond to a P100. Cheap, easy to breath, they last for few days.

If you have any friends who work in accident prevention, you can ask if they have expired filters to give you for free. The filters, if sealed, never expire, but they can no longer be sold by law.

If you are short of money, you can take one of those surplus US Army ordnance gas masks that are sold for €15. They come in sealed cans with a supplied filter, and are still valid despite being 30 years old. Filters are always screw-type EN-148 (RD40).  P3 R filter will fit this second hand masks.

Once worn, the mask must no longer be removed, because it is inevitable to rub it on the skin or hair that may have come into contact with the virus. Remember to put the mask in a bag and disinfect it as soon as possible.

Always carry a spare disposable mask in a sealed bag. You never know... 

&amp;#x200B;

**DISPOSABLE MASKS CAN BE RE-USED !!!**

Yes, it’s true. There are 3 methods for sanitizing an used P95 mask:

* 1) Leave them to soak for 15 min in a chlorine solution (40ml of bleach per liter of water). Cons: They stink of chlorine and must be dried to perfection after washing.
* 2) Sterilize them with UVC lamps. A special light is used that kills microorganisms. A lamp costs about thirty euros on Amazon, buy those with 18W power at least. Cons: you can do a maximum of 3 sterilization cycles, then the UVs destroy the plastic of the valves and elastics. The lamps must be used with extreme caution, there is a risk of permanent damage to the eyes. There are lamps that in addition to light also produce ozone. Find out about it.
* 3) Sterilize them with ozone. It is the best method, it is inexpensive, it is very effective and does not damage the materials. Cons: you need a procedure and a suitable environment because ozone kills living organisms and seriously damages your lungs. And for “suitable” it means turning on the machine, run out of the room, seal the door with paper tape and wait two hours after the end of the cycle. Enter the room holding your breath, open all the windows and wait for another 2 hours before using the room. An ozone-producing machine costs 100 € on amazon, but the price for a DIY drops to 40 €. Buy plates that produce at least 10g / hour.

With ozone, you can also disinfect the P3 R filters of half-face masks, but you must invent a method for letting the the ozone go inside the filter.

Absolutely do not disinfect the disposable masks or the P3 R filters with alcohol, because alcohol removes the electrostatic charge of the materials and makes them unusable.

You will wonder if it is possible to go through an epidemic with a single disposable mask: NO. The micro textile fabric will become clogged with dust sooner or later, and will no longer let the air pass, thus making it enter from the sides and making the mask itself useless. My advice is to wash it as per point 1 every now and then, and always use ozone. Be aware that even if you are careful, you will need 3 or 4 disposable masks per month. I know that the prices are skyrocketing, but they have not yet reached their peak.

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, this are case studies about the sterilization of the disposable masks.

&amp;#x200B;

**SAFETY GOGGLES**

The idea is to prevent droplets from an infected person to come into contact with your mucous membranes (and eyes). So any kind of shielding should be appreciated.

The best goggles are the NON-VENTILATED ones, they are soft and seal the eye area.

If they are no longer available, ventilated ones are also fine, but you have to seal each opening with tape / hot glue.

Ski goggles are also fine if properly sealed.

The plastic screens used for gardening and chainsaw works are cheap but due to the opening on the sides they are not the best, and they are extremely bulky. They are excellent if used in combos with goggles.

If you can't afford protective goggles, eyeglasses or sunglasses are still better than nothing.

If you have a full face shield with positive pressure and electric ventilation, please marry me. 

As with everything else, these devices should not be removed once worn. Remember to sanitize them regularly.

&amp;#x200B;

**GLOVES**

Disinfectant gel is nowhere to be found (as long as you don't do it at home) and a chlorine disinfection of the hands is tedious and dangerous. In addition, chemicals and frequent washing can lead to chapping, cuts and irritation. And it is always better to avoid contact with the virus, where possible.

I suggest to stock up on nitrile gloves as long as they are available and the price is normal. I say nitrile because it is hypoallergenic, but if you tolerate the other materials, go for them since they cost even less.

A dozen boxes can be good for the moment, considering that the pandemic will last for at least 6-8 months. The US gov. has just ordered a hundred million boxes (yes, the number is right), so I assume they will be the new gold.

You should always remove the second glove with the inside of the first one, as doctors do.

You must wear gloves as soon as you leave the house, and it is not bad to have two spare pairs in your pocket. The rule not to reuse them always applies.

Stock up on hand moisturizer, with all this hand washing you will find yourself with shredded leather instead of skin.

&amp;#x200B;

**SHOES**

Shoes are a phenomenal vehicle for viruses and bacteria, especially the sole, so they should be protected. Supermarkets sell packs of 100 blue shoe covers for € 3. The kind they give you in hospitals. Stock up and use them, but never reusing them.

They are also excellent as a hair cap to wear under the mask. Protecting hair is important because droplets end there too. Maybe you strict to the rules all day, then you get home, undress, wash your hands ... and scratch your head, infecting your hands again.

Shoes must be removed before entering the house, and where possible, left outside the door.

It is not bad to disinfect them with a shoe spray occasionally. If they are old and priceless, disinfect them with chlorine (chlorine stains).

&amp;#x200B;

**SUITS AND CLOTHING**

Clothing is also important because the droplets of an infected end up everywhere: on your shirt, jeans, hairs. It is useless to wash your hands well if you scratch your shoulder immediately later: your hands are infected again, but maybe you didn't noticed and...BAM you're dead.

The advice is to undress completely once you get home, throw everything to wash and run in the shower. The ideal would be a containment environment, but I'll talk about it later.

It is unthinkable to wash your coat every evening, I know, but you can leave it on a chair at the front door, and possibly sanitize it with UV or ozone.

Particular attention should be paid to frequently used objects, such as wallets and keys that we keep in our pockets every day. I keep the contaminated and frequently used material in the left pocket of the jacket (wallet and disinfectant). On the right I keep my house keys and some tissues, which I never use soften. The same goes for trousers: in the left pocket I keep the change coins, which have passed from hand to hand, and therefore are potentially infected. In the right pocket I keep the uncontaminated thing. When I got home I throw coins and keys in a container with bleach solution.

For those who want to exaggerate, or for those who must visit a relative who is certainly infected, you can wear a protective suit. I realize that living and working in a protective suit is complicated, and especially premature given the small number of cases in the world. However here are some tips:

Suits for painters in woven fabric are useless. Those of category 4/5/6 (plasticized with protected seams) are nowhere to be found at fair prices.

The do-it-yourself alternative are the NBC suits that are sold as a army surplus. They are heavy and make you sweat, but they cost about 10€.

Workwear rain suits also work well, because they are light and inexpensive. Warning: plastic kway do not resist viruses. The rain suits (the yellow ones used by fishermen) are ok.

NBC and rain suits can be sanitized with chlorine solution (they are plastic). The suit must be worn in a clean environment (before leaving home).

In the case of a protective suit you must wear normal gloves and another pair of gloves on top. Those for washing dishes are the best. The edge must be placed over the cuffs of the suit, and blocked with some adhesive tape. Dishwashing gloves can be reused after disinfection and they resist traction when you move.

Same goes for shoes. The ideal would be to have rubber boots, the suit over the boots and some tape on the ankles. When you return to a safe place, spray yourself with disinfectant, rub, rinse and then undress.

You can easily find a packs of 100 blue plastic aprons for € 5 in supermarket. It is not bad to have a couple ready for use, especially for covering a seat or to be put on the fly when someone is coughing too hard. 2 folded aprons take less space than a credit card.

&amp;#x200B;

**DISINFECTANTS**

The most effective disinfectant for viruses and bacteria is chlorine. It is found in various forms (commercial names, bleach, tablets) and at various prices.

I do not recommend bleach, because you can only disinfect items as it contains perfumes and other chemical products. With pure chlorine tablets, on the other hand, you can also disinfect fruits and vegetables and they cost infinitely less.

1 liter of ready-to-use food grade chlorine solution: € 8.

1 liter of homemade chlorine solution starting from the tablets: € 0.0012.

Chlorine tablets are found in the supermarket, hardware stores and shops that sell swimming pool tools and hardware.

Chlorine stains - obviously – and it must NEVER be mixed with other chemicals. Unfortunately it degrades easily on contact with air and light. For this reason it should be kept in non-transparent bottles and in a dark cabinet.

Once the chlorine tablet has been dissolved in water, you should use the solution within a few days. Look for the correct water / chlorine ratios on google.

To disinfect an object you must be careful to clean it from coarse dirt, and let the chlorine act at least 10 minutes. After disinfection, rinse with water, because chlorine corrodes metals.

If you want to carry a disinfectant gel with you, you can do it at home starting from 96-volume alcohol, 3% hydrogen peroxide and glycerin. Instruction are on several government website or searching the internet. If you only have 90-volume alcohol, remember that you need 888ml instead of 833ml for a liter of product.

If you really want a commercial grade disinfectant, you can do it by electrolysis but you need graphite, a stove and a bench power supply.

Forget about any other type of sanitizer, spray or disinfectant. They are useless and expensive. Rather, invest in 90-volume alcohol as long as it is available, which you will need for the spray disinfectant solution. Alcohol will be the new champagne, so buy a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

**PROCEDURES AND CONTAINMENT**

I know it's tedious, but in order not to get sick you have to imagine you will be immediately exposed to the virus once you leave your house. So you have to get used to acting right.

No nose picking, even if you've just washed your hands.

Don't scratch if your face itch and you don't have absolutely clean hands. 

Try to check every time you touch your face, and if you realize that you do too often and involuntarily, use my method: water and chili solution on your fingertips. After a week your urge to scratch will be gone.

I repeat, the less you touch the orifices (or near), the better.

Wash your face several time a day with hot water and plenty of soap.

Spend 5 minutes watching a youtube video on how surgeons wash their hands and try to imitate. Let them drain with your elbows down and your fingers up.

Your car, unlike your home, is not to be considered a safe environment. Take care to disinfect it with ozone whenever possible, with the engine running and internal recirculation activated.

If you don't have an ozone machine, clean the seats, gearbox, belt and steering wheel with 70-volume alcohol.

Turn off any air circulation and fans when you are driving. So no heating, no air conditioning, no heated seats: you want to minimize the circulation of the virus.

Public transportation is a big problem. I recommend using gloves and touch as few things as possible, and use a barrier before sitting down (an old shopping bag for example).

Airplanes are safer because they have air recirculation filters. If possible choose the front and bottom seats, they are the ones with the least probability of contagion. Enter last and exit first.

Trains are to be considered like any other public transport. Try to stay as far away from other people as possible.

If you are talking with someone outdoor, position yourself upwind, so that the droplets of your interlocutor will struggle to reach you.

If you work in an office, do not use the common coat rack, but put the jacket / coat on your chair.

If possible, move your desk / workplace to a sunny spot, UV rays help speed up virus death.

The same advice is ok for clothes at home, if you have no way to sanitize them you can leave them exposed to the sun's rays.

Avoid the collective coffee break, go on your own or ask the employer to stagger the employees (and do it first).

As I said before, the ideal would be to have a containment room at home, where you can undress and leave potentially infected objects.

It makes no sense, however, to undress at the entrance if you have underfloor heating, or worse, a fan that can circulate the virus around the house.

You can then attach plastic sheets (the painter’s kind. They are light and thin) to the ceiling and walls near the front door. A 4x4 meter plastic sheet will cost € 2. In this way you will create an environment that is certainly not watertight, but very effective for containing the virus.

The ideal would be to have a secondary entrance to your room, or an entrance from the garage.

At home I can enter from the garage, where I created a 2x1m room with murals, recycled plywood panels and plastic sheeting.

In there I have a spray of water and chlorine, one of 70-volume alcohol, a sink, a basket for used masks, a bag for linen and a container to throw all the objects that I will disinfect on the spot by immersion. It is also the environment that I use for sanitizing with ozone.

Another suggestion to be done at home and everywhere, is to open and close the doors with your elbows. Make a habit of touching objects in a different ways from other. 

If you live in a family and everyone opens the fridge by pulling the handle, you should open it by pulling the door from below for example. If the drawers are open by pulling them from the center ... you should open them by taking by the side.

Touch, if you really must, where people are not used to touch.

Since it is not yet clear whether the virus is spreading through the intestine, avoid going to public restrooms. To change the time you usually poo, use kiwi fruits.

Alternatively, if you really must, disinfect the entire WC with a spray of chlorine solution, letting it sit for 10 minutes. Pull the water by pressing the button with your feet, and hold your breath, because the toilet flushes the water and potentially dangerous micro particles are created.

If you have a pet there shouldn't be any major problems. Avoid having it caressed/patted by others and take it for a walk at 3 pm, or when the sun is still high and the UV rays have had some chance of destroying any presence of viruses (spit from other passersby / pee / garbage).

It is a good thing to disinfect the paws with 70-volume alcohol upon returning home, in order not to contaminate the home environment.

If you have scheduled medical examinations, see how the situation develops.

If you have a chipped teeth to fix and you have always delayed, take care of it in these days. You need to minimize any future errands in order to avoid people or crowded places.

Today in Italy EMS were totally empty, but once the initial fear will be gone, thousands of Karen will rush to the hospitals believing they are infected. Remember your goal: always to go to uncrowded places.

However, everything listed above is functional if respected by all family members. If you have a fatalist at home (and you don't share a bed with him/her) you have to adopt other strategies. Take care of washing the dishes, to be sure a) they’re clean b) to prevent someone else besides you from touching them. 

Shift your schedules to spend as little time as possible with others. Make up an excuse to eat 10 minutes later and not having to share the table with your brother.

Unfortunately I am not practical in this (my SO is very collaborative) and I do not have many tips for you.

&amp;#x200B;

**STOCKS AND FOOD**

Last Sunday the whole Italy rushed to the grocery stores. Everyone were angry and upset. 

The idea of ​​stocking up, however, is not so bad, because as already mentioned, you must take advantage of the current situation (little spread of the disease) to attend public places. And since it is still possible to move and there is no quarantine, sometimes shopping centers in neighboring countries have better prices.

Since **we are not going to face a world war**, and certainly **the government will not cut electricity, gas and water**, you should buy non-perishable goods that will still serve you in the future, even if the situation improves.

I’m talking about pasta, rice, tuna cans, canned meat, legumes, flour, oil, salt, sugar, honey, rolls of paper and toilet paper. Then disposable gloves, hand soaps, shower soaps and chlorine tablets. Nothing else. Oil, sugar, salt, honey never expire, even if the packaging must have an expiration date by law. Tuna, legumes and canned meat last 3 years. Pasta, rice and flour 2 years.

If you really are pessimistic, buy some vitamins. 

Go shopping when there are notoriously few people in supermarkets, that is around 1pm/1:30pm or during the night.

If you have to other shopping, do it these days.

&amp;#x200B;

**OTHER AND VARIOUS**

Money, coins, credit cards and all the material that is handled is often considered dangerous.

Put your wallet, perhaps made of leather, in a ziplock bag, so you can disinfect the bag without damaging the content.

Avoid handshakes, kisses and hugs (except for your mom, you should always hug your mum).

Avoid crowded places, or where there is a concentration of people that will not allow you to be at least 2.5m away from others.

&amp;#x200B;

2218,Coronavirus kit on a budget?,"Without going into a crazy buying binge (we just can't afford it), what does a realistic coronavirus survival kit look like? How long should a kit last (two weeks, a month, etc.)? Is it crazy to make a night trip into town to some 24 hour locations or could we wait until the weekend when our schedule frees up? We live in an isolated, rural area. We don't have an endless list of options to shop from and it is an hour drive to 24 hour locations that have supplies.

We did have a 30 day supply of food and first aid as we live in a natural disaster prone area. However, in a recent move we discovered that our largest container of food and pet food was damaged and about 75% of the contents were ruined.  We have a decent first aid supply kit, but are running low on isopropyl alcohol and medical grade hand sanitizer, but we do have enough antiseptic wipes to last a long time, plus other basic first aid supplies. 

However, as we live in a rural area surrounded by tons of outdoor activities, we do use our first aid supplies quite often and probably need to stock up. 

Would love to see a list of essentials and quantities of those essentials specifically for the event of a coronavirus outbreak in our area. I know that four people are self monitoring about an hour away and I suspect the number to go up. 

We are working on a budget. Neither of us gets paid until first week of March. We are not wealthy and do not have a ton of savings. Also, we live on an island. Supply chains being interrupted would effect us drastically. What items do you think will sell out first? We have N95 masks and I keep checking stores for more and buy them when I find them. We just moved so a lot of things are still in boxes, but it appears it is time to finish unpacking.

Edit: I am all over the place but I tried to lay out what I am talking about clearly. Sorry :/

I am seriously looking at getting a solar/battery setup ASAP in case this virus takes out so many workers power is not a guarantee. I have two parents that require medical equipment to sleep and thus my dilemma. Here we go!

3 machines that pull 120 watts at 120 volts =360 watts/h x 8hr = 2880 watts a night

1 machine that pulls 340 watts at 120 volts = 340watts/h x 8hr = 2720 watts a night

Total watts is 5600. Which is about 470 amp hours a night

I would prefer to go the solar/battery route as that involves less gas/propane storage and less need to be out doing things. Is this math right do yall think?

2226,A Regular Dude’s Guide to General Prepping for Whatever the Fuck it is That’s Going to Kill Everyone,"&amp;#x200B;

I got a pretty good response to a small blurb I put out about my prep efforts, so here is a nice THICC list of all the things I’ve done to prepare for the arrival of apocalypse-chan 

Here is a list of some basic stuff I’ve bought to prepare for an inevitable disaster, COVID19 or otherwise. I’m not selling anything, and I’m not an alarmist. This list is meant to increase the general population’s preparedness and reduce the negative impact of shortages. COST SHOULD NOT BE A BARRIER TO CREATING A BASIC SAFETY NET. I have very limited resources and only picked up what I considered to be necessary to protect and nourish myself for a month or so without any outside assistance from the government, local or otherwise. PROTECTION, WATER, FOOD are the basic tenets. Further down on the list would be meds, shelter and other things needed if services are suspended for longer periods of time. As long as you have enough food and water to last a few weeks, and the means to defend those resources from others you have a great start. This thread is meant to encourage others to post their own ideas for basic prepping, our strength is in our collective knowledge! I am therefore posting this in multiple subs to foster a conversation amongst like-minded users for maximum impact :)

Here’s my list, as of the time of this post (All amounts in USD)

Defense (Shop at Local Gun Store, Walmart, Ebay, Amazon): Savage/Stevens Pump Action 12 Gauge Shotgun (with bandolier and tactical light), 100+ rounds of assorted shells with different loads, AR500 4-plate ballistic Vest system, used surplus PASGT ballistic helmet: \~ $450.00 

Canned food (Shop at Grocery Outlet, Cash and Carry, Costco, Winco): Garbanzo beans, refried beans, vienna sausage, potted meat, ass. Veggies, powdered milk, powdered whey mix, powdered protein meal replacement pouches \~ $40.00

Dry Food (Shop at Grocery Outlet, Cash and Carry, Costco, Winco): Boxed Pasta (Requires boiled water obv.) Protein bars, Paleo nut bars, dried manderin oranges, dried dates, pumpkin seeds, LOTS of iodized salt, dill pickle pringles (for funsies) \~ $50.00

WATER (Costco is good but get this shit anywhere it's still available. Can’t put a price on hydration): 80X16 oz. + Lifestraw personal water filtration system, Diluted bleach (for water purification) \~ $20.00

Medical (Anywhere): Basic First Aid kit, Iodine, cheap, sharp knife \~ $20.00

Total Cost: \~ $600.00

Vulnerabilities: No shelter provision, only basic medical supplies, no signaling equipment, no communication equipment, no provision for miasma or other fallout (I figure if I need to put on a hazmat setup to go outdoors I don’t care to live anymore. I’m not trying to outlive the end of humanity, I just don’t want to collapse from dehydration or get jacked by a looter like an idiot if there is a hiccup in societal order)

Again this is pretty basic stuff. I’m not interested in building a bunker and hunkering down for the long night, just a regular guy concerned about the alarming lack of preparedness I witness on the news everyday.

2230,Self-Quarantine tips?,"My husband’s coworker is bringing their parents from Korea tomorrow. With the whole situation going on in Korea right now, especially with the fact that they are from the city where a mass outbreak occurred, I want to take precautions measure. I, a mother of a newborn, is kind of paranoid right now. I know I am overreacting a bit but I want to prepare for the worst situation.

I am assuming 1: the coworker's parents are infected, 2: there will be physical contact between the coworker's parents and the coworker, 3: the parents probability won't self-quarantine themselves for two weeks and will be in close proximity with the coworker

My husband and his coworker carpooling together so they are going to be in close contact.

Anyway since I can't blatantly say ”my husband will not carpool with you” because I don't want to offend him. So I want to perform an intensive sanitizing station for my husband after work. I could only think of him changing and washing immediately every night after coming from work.

Some of our ongoing food pandemic prep...

Pantry looks massive but shelves are actually very shallow, so I think we will need to buy and store more items elsewhere. (We are planning to get more peanut butter, corn chips, hot sauce, apples [since they keep very well], jarred fruit, etc.) 

The drawers are barely functional so not a great place to store heavy items like canned food but they are holding together at present.

We also have a decent stockpile of rice and pasta and some ramen. I’m worried that it looks like a lot but might not actually be enough? What do you think we should get more of?

2233,Firearms and Prepping,"I've seen some people express interest in firearms given the current events so I would like to use this post as a place to discuss firearms preparedness and have it serve as a place for people unfamiliar with firearms to ask questions. This post is aimed at Americans and is only intended to educate others on self defense and is in no way advocating for violence. 

**GUN SELECTION**

For new shooters; consider a shotgun for self defense. If you consider yourself weaker, get a 20 gauge. Stronger people should go with a 12 gauge. Regardless of gauge get a mossberg. Either a Mossberg 500 (https://guns2ammo.com/product/mossberg-50121-500-flex-all-purpose-pump-12-gauge-28-3-black-synthetic-stk-blackblued-barrel) or a maverick 88 (https://gun.deals/product/mossberg-maverick-88-security-12-ga-shotgun-185-barrel-6-shot-blue-19999-shipped)  The latter being extremely affordable. Both of these guns come in 12 and 20 gauge. 

**AMMO**

More is better always. When you think you have enough, buy more. For self defense; use 00 buckshot. Don't buy birdshot; slugs if you've got the barrel for it and know how to place them (and also don't mind a sore shoulder). 00 buckshot will be more than good enough for any engagement within your home or property. 

**TRAINING**

There are plenty of home defense videos on youtube that you can educate yourself with. That said, hit the range and test out your firearm. Get comfortable with it. Gear is worth as much as the experience of the person behind it. If there's not a range near you, usually there is government land that you can shoot on for free. 

**PREPARING**

You never want to be in a gunfight. Avoid violence at all costs. That said, people suck and ""good"" people are only a few missed meals away from ""bad"" people.

2237,A thought about pregnancy,"I’m 14 weeks pregnant (what a time to be going through this, right?!) and beyond my concern in having a weakened immune system during a pandemic, I realized most pregnant women depend on a few extra essentials that we should probably stock up on. For me, this is a special iron and b vitamin supplement called Floradix that comes from Germany- I just ordered several bottles last night. I suffer from pregnancy-induced anemia and I literally cannot go without this item. Many other women will need something similar. Also, prenatal vitamins, safe forms of cheese and fish and meat (pregnant women must avoid quite a few normal food items like soft or raw milk cheeses, a lot of different high heavy metal fish, etc. (these recommendations vary regionally and culturally but in the U.S. are usually observed, particularly the listeria high risk foods). Pregnant women cannot use many common over the counter medications, so make sure you have plenty of what you are allowed to use. For example, for reducing fever, Tylenol is permitted but most others like Motrin are not. Most cough and decongestants are not safe during pregnancy, so find the few that are, just in case. 

Going into the doctor or hospital for checkups during pregnancy could eventually become high risk if spread happens in your community. I am not saying don’t get your checkups, but I did go ahead and order a blood pressure monitor as that is one of the most important vitals to check when you are pregnant to make sure you aren’t getting toxemia. It’s good for peace of mind if perhaps an appointment needs to be postponed for a few weeks due to overwhelmed hospital systems. 

If you can afford to, going ahead and getting some diapers and wipes (cloth is even better if you plan to do that anyways), formula (even if you’ll be breastfeeding, it might be good to have some on hand- it may become scarce eventually and if you come to need it, it would be terrible not to have any), a breast pump, bottles, common postpartum aftercare items like witch hazel, salves and sitz baths for healing tears, breastfeeding teas and oats. When baby arrives. They don’t need much beyond a healthy mama and milk, so making sure you have plenty of extra extra food stored for additional caloric needs (you need extra during pregnancy, and then even more extra during nursing if you choose to do that) is crucial. It will be difficult to produce enough milk if you are calorie or even nutritionally deficient. 

I was already planning to have a home birth with a nurse midwife- (if this pregnancy continues to be low risk). I have previously had 2. I know this choice can sometimes be controversial but it might make the most sense in a pandemic- you stay in your own home and won’t be exposed to potential coronavirus patients and won’t be relying on an already taxed system. If this is something you are doing too, talk with your midwife to make sure you and her have the birth supplies in possession plenty in advance just in case certain medical supplies are in short supply (things like gloves, hibiclens, disposable underpads, disposable postpartum underpants, etc.",PandemicPreps,1582816166,snowfallingsoftly,24,1,True,2020-02-27 07:09:26,weeks pregnant time going right beyond concern weakened immune system pandemic realized pregnant women depend extra essentials probably stock special iron b vitamin supplement called floradix comes germany ordered several bottles last night suffer pregnancy induced anemia literally cannot go without item many women need something similar also prenatal vitamins safe forms cheese fish meat pregnant women must avoid quite normal food items like soft raw milk cheeses lot different high heavy metal fish etc recommendations vary regionally culturally u usually observed particularly listeria high risk foods pregnant women cannot use many common counter medications make sure plenty allowed use example reducing fever tylenol permitted others like motrin cough decongestants safe pregnancy find case doctor hospital checkups pregnancy could eventually become high risk spread happens community saying get checkups go ahead order blood pressure monitor one important vitals check pregnant make sure getting toxemia good peace mind perhaps appointment needs postponed weeks due overwhelmed hospital systems afford going ahead getting diapers wipes cloth even better plan anyways formula even breastfeeding might good hand may become scarce eventually come need would terrible breast pump bottles common postpartum aftercare items like witch hazel salves sitz baths healing tears breastfeeding teas oats baby arrives need much beyond healthy mama milk making sure plenty extra extra food stored additional caloric needs need extra pregnancy even extra nursing choose crucial difficult produce enough milk calorie even nutritionally deficient already planning home birth nurse midwife pregnancy continues low risk previously know choice sometimes controversial might make sense pandemic stay home exposed potential coronavirus patients relying already taxed system something talk midwife make sure birth supplies possession plenty advance case certain medical supplies short supply things like gloves hibiclens disposable underpads disposable postpartum underpants etc,week pregnant time go right beyond concern weaken immun system pandem realiz pregnant women depend extra essenti probabl stock special iron b vitamin supplement call floradix come germani order sever bottl last night suffer pregnanc induc anemia liter cannot go without item mani women need someth similar also prenat vitamin safe form chees fish meat pregnant women must avoid quit normal food item like soft raw milk chees lot differ high heavi metal fish etc recommend vari region cultur u usual observ particularli listeria high risk food pregnant women cannot use mani common counter medic make sure plenti allow use exampl reduc fever tylenol permit other like motrin cough decongest safe pregnanc find case doctor hospit checkup pregnanc could eventu becom high risk spread happen commun say get checkup go ahead order blood pressur monitor one import vital check pregnant make sure get toxemia good peac mind perhap appoint need postpon week due overwhelm hospit system afford go ahead get diaper wipe cloth even better plan anyway formula even breastfeed might good hand may becom scarc eventu come need would terribl breast pump bottl common postpartum aftercar item like witch hazel salv sitz bath heal tear breastfeed tea oat babi arriv need much beyond healthi mama milk make sure plenti extra extra food store addit calor need need extra pregnanc even extra nurs choos crucial difficult produc enough milk calori even nutrit defici alreadi plan home birth nurs midwif pregnanc continu low risk previous know choic sometim controversi might make sens pandem stay home expos potenti coronaviru patient reli alreadi tax system someth talk midwif make sure birth suppli possess plenti advanc case certain medic suppli short suppli thing like glove hibiclen dispos underpad dispos postpartum underp etc

2243,"Prepping for a family, the importance of make sure everybody's on the same page","Yesterday I took my son to the pediatrician (which is housed in a complex that already treat other outpatients) to assess his language problems..

Even though I'm the 'prepper' person of the family, my wife insisted to wear surgical masks during the visit.

(I'm in New Zealand, the risk is somewhat low atm, currently I'm not super concerned if we wore masks or not) 

I actually discouraged my wife from using a N95 mask as we should be saving them when the pandemic hits IMO. plus what's the point of one person using N95 and rest of the family use surgical masks? (she only has one N95 with her on that day)

My mother inlaw also went with us, I was warning my wife not to let my inlaw to come with us to reduce the risk of exposure. Still I wasn't pushing too hard.. so she came with us.

After we got off the car, I started to instruct everyone to put the masks on, especially my son.. we got into the elevator and walked about 100meters in the hallway.. then I turned around and noticed my mother inlaw did not wear her masks.

at this point I told my son, just forget about the mask.. there's not much point if one member of the family isn't protecting herself.  plus we stand a better chance of surviving than my mother in law if it comes to that..

I pleaded and begged her to be extra vigilant when the time comes, at the moment New Zealand is officially virus free (in reality who knows, but still).  

I would like to use this example to highlight how important it is to make sure everyone in your family is on the same page, or else no matter how much prepping you do, the virus would still slip thru the cracks and get to you and your family.",PandemicPreps,1582826184,onektruths,0,1,True,2020-02-27 09:56:24,yesterday took son pediatrician housed complex already treat outpatients assess language problems though prepper person family wife insisted wear surgical masks visit new zealand risk somewhat low atm currently super concerned wore masks actually discouraged wife using n mask saving pandemic hits imo plus point one person using n rest family use surgical masks one n day mother inlaw also went us warning wife let inlaw come us reduce risk exposure still pushing hard came us got car started instruct everyone put masks especially son got elevator walked meters hallway turned around noticed mother inlaw wear masks point told son forget mask much point one member family protecting plus stand better chance surviving mother law comes pleaded begged extra vigilant time comes moment new zealand officially virus free reality knows still would like use example highlight important make sure everyone family page else matter much prepping virus would still slip thru cracks get family,yesterday took son pediatrician hous complex alreadi treat outpati assess languag problem though prepper person famili wife insist wear surgic mask visit new zealand risk somewhat low atm current super concern wore mask actual discourag wife use n mask save pandem hit imo plu point one person use n rest famili use surgic mask one n day mother inlaw also went us warn wife let inlaw come us reduc risk exposur still push hard came us got car start instruct everyon put mask especi son got elev walk meter hallway turn around notic mother inlaw wear mask point told son forget mask much point one member famili protect plu stand better chanc surviv mother law come plead beg extra vigil time come moment new zealand offici viru free realiti know still would like use exampl highlight import make sure everyon famili page els matter much prep viru would still slip thru crack get famili

2246,Not Only a Threat To Himself But a Threat To Us,"My fiancee and I have begun prepping. We've been aware of and interested in it for a while as both of us see the simple rational logic behind doing so. We have also both had a sinking feeling that the world would face a large ordeal at some point in our lives. The threat that is Covid 19 was the final kick in the arse for us to do so and we've already made our first stocking run, (WinCo is amazing by the way). We've been following advice on here, other threads, and from other preppers and I already feel more secure. 

The problem is that we are not alone. We have a roommate. And he thinks we are crazy. Our roommate, we'll call him ""M"", is...how to say...willfully ignorant. Through my own research and the great detective work of some Reddit communities, I've been right so far about how this is all going to play out. M, however, has not believed me at every turn, even when I was proven right. Not only does he not believe that Covid 19 is not a threat, he openly mocks us for preparing for it. I care for him, we are friends, and I want him to be safe as well, but he refuses to take any precautions. He trusted the media when they said it wasn't a big deal, ""Just the flu,"" and now he doesn't trust them now that they are admitting that there will be ""disruptions"".

He is the kind of guy that spends all of his money on games and VR and his normalcy bias is extraordinarily deep. The other day when he ordered a Lyft to work we noticed that it was coming from the airport. Naturally, I assumed that it had picked up or dropped someone off that had flown. I told him quite calmly to wash his hands when he gets to work and not to touch his face.

He exploded on me.

Literally screamed at me. It was so irrational that I was stunned. He said that even if it's in America that it will never come here to Tulsa because no one comes to Tulsa... As if the Virus might decide, ""Tulsa? Who goes there? Screw that place."" And he was serious. He literally believes this. Tulsa Oklahoma has an ***International Airport.*** Yesterday he came downstairs while we were putting up our haul of non-perishable food in the closet and looked aghast that we were putting food away instead of just eating it. When we explained that it was for in case there is a lockdown or quarantine he pursed his lips and rolled his eyes so hard that I thought they'd fall out. 

Fine. He won't look out for himself but if he gets the virus he will bring it home to us. He will not self-isolate, he will not wash his hands or anything else. He complains that we are using ***our money*** on prepping. Of course, that's because we buy all the food and house supplies because his money goes to games, his phone, and so on.

I am kicking myself for not prepping sooner, when the first reports came out of China I wondered if I should start preparing. I didn’t, and now I’m regretting it. 
So far I’ve got the following sorted
-supply of medication, over the counter &amp; regular stuff like paracetamol/ibuprofen/co-codamol/cold and flu etc. The only thing I have less than a months supply of is anti-depressants (though I have an order in now to pick up early next week and I’m going to see if I can request an extra month just to be on the safe side)
-food - we’re lucky cause we have a good stock of tins already in including beans/pulses/veg and plenty of pasta/rice etc (though I have more being delivered this weekend)
- water - is one of the ones I’m worried about. We rely on tap water (which has always been fine - drinking tap water in the U.K. isn’t unusual) and I’m seriously considering buying bottled water as well just in case, does anyone have any advice on how much to buy

2248,Death rate of covid19 2% or 3.4%?,"I don't know if it is just that I'm not understanding statistics enough or I'm missing something else or my math is just wrong.  I've been watching the numbers [here] (https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) since at least a month ago as that's when I first ordered masks, but maybe longer? It seems like the death rate has been pretty steady at 3.4% while the recovered rate is going up as it should.  But the US news reports keep saying 2%. I'm dividing number of deaths by number of confirmed cases.  Is that not where this statistic should come from?  It's not a huge difference at first glance but that means either 200 or 340 people die out of 1000 on average, compared to less than 10 out of 1000 dying from the regular seasonal flu.  A difference of an average of 140 deaths is a big one especially if you are talking to someone who insists this is just like the regular flu.  And all of that is if we assume that the number of confirmed cases are accurate and that the number of deaths caused by this are accurate which I doubt.  I imagine there are an awful lot of people who have it but have tested negative due to faulty or too early tests and a lot of people who were never tested because their symptoms are mild.  That would make the statistics better.  But if a government isn't counting deaths because they are calling it something else, than that would be worse.  

I'd love if someone who understands this better could break it down to help me understand the numbers better because it seems like I'm missing something or else the US is trying to minimize the numbers.",PandemicPreps,1582829040,justme_mb,5,1,True,2020-02-27 10:44:00,know understanding statistics enough missing something else math wrong watching numbers since least month ago first ordered masks maybe longer seems like death rate pretty steady recovered rate going us news reports keep saying dividing number deaths number confirmed cases statistic come huge difference first glance means either people die average compared less dying regular seasonal flu difference average deaths big one especially talking someone insists like regular flu assume number confirmed cases accurate number deaths caused accurate doubt imagine awful lot people tested negative due faulty early tests lot people never tested symptoms mild would make statistics better government counting deaths calling something else would worse love someone understands better could break help understand numbers better seems like missing something else us trying minimize numbers,know understand statist enough miss someth els math wrong watch number sinc least month ago first order mask mayb longer seem like death rate pretti steadi recov rate go us news report keep say divid number death number confirm case statist come huge differ first glanc mean either peopl die averag compar less die regular season flu differ averag death big one especi talk someon insist like regular flu assum number confirm case accur number death caus accur doubt imagin aw lot peopl test neg due faulti earli test lot peopl never test symptom mild would make statist better govern count death call someth els would wors love someon understand better could break help understand number better seem like miss someth els us tri minim number

Part of me thinks it would be better to just try and figure out a way to finance going to the countryside, but the other half of me thinks that staying in the capitol will be better - better access to medical resources, plus a government is going to be more focused on its capitol than anywhere else.

2252,"First time prepping, looking to see if you more experienced individuals think my family and possibly GF as well is set for ~3weeks in the event of quarantine.","Hey everyone, I was looking for some feedback on my current supplies to see if we're set to handle maybe a 3-4 week quarantine. We tend to already ""stockpile"" a certain staple foods (beans for example), but if I could get some quick feedback on what I have so far and what else I should get, I'd appreciate it. I mostly went and just bought extra of what we tend to already eat, and some additional misc items to be on the safe side. I tried to avoid anything that would need refrigeration or freezing as a precaution (I don't believe we'd lose power over the outbreak, but better safe than sorry).

If after reading this list you could give me a grocery list of things I've missed or should be getting, I'd greatly appreciate it. When I finally have my own home soon I fully intend to prep for things like this in the future, this has been a big learning opportunity for myself and my family.

3 of us total, adults, potentially 4 if my girlfriend needed to stay here in a pinch:

\- Water: 18 gallons in jugs, 180 16oz bottles, we don't expect water to be cut off but I might get another 2 cases of 40 bottles while they're cheap since they'd last far past any outbreak anyway. Right now in total we're at about 40gal water with the potential to get more from the tap or from buying it but I don't think this would be enough if water was cut for a month, I might be overreacting on water.

\- Canned food: 30 cans of beans (15 pinto, 15 black), 40 cans of soups (variety, I went for high protein choices), 10 cans green beans, 10 cans corn (last 2 we already had but didn't seem as essential to stockpile). I intend to go buy more food tonight, probably a mix of vegetables and fruits up to another 30 cans. We don't usually use canned fruits or vegetables much so I'm not sure these would be used long term, so advice here would be great. I read dry beans were a great option for more long term use but since we already had a lot of canned beans it seemed unnecessary with the frequency we use them.

\- Rice: 10lbs Basmati rice uncooked.

\- 10 packages of freeze dried or dried fruits (strawberries, mangoes, apricots), might be wise to get more of these, I'm not sure. It seems like these are the better option for a potential 3-4wk lockdown compared to getting other options than canned maybe.

\- We have about 20 different frozen dinners, 18 oven cook crab cakes, and between frozen chicken and steak probably about 10-15lbs of meat there, but I'd like to not have to rely on it in the case of power failure, these were on hand already.

\- 5lbs granola.

\- 4 family sized boxes of various cereals to eat dry.

\- 50 pack of Nutrigrain bars.

\- 4 boxes of pasta already on hand.

\- 24 pack of Cliff bars.

\- 4 packages of beef jerky, and 24ct of beef sticks (just as a protein source).

\- Random misc food we already have on hand: box of oatmeal, like 5 bags of misc chips, lots of snack food.

\- Cleaning supplies: 2 new bottles of Clorox bleach, 2 cans Lysol, 10 tubs of Clorox Wipes, 3 new bottles Hand soap, 2 larger bottles of hand sanitizer, 24 rolls toilet paper new (without about another 20 stored around the house), 24 paper towel rolls (with another 10 or so around the house), 100ct Nitrile gloves, and we should be getting a 10ct box of N95 masks soon but if not that's fine since we'd lock down here anyway. We do have 3 masks, but without elastic and I cannot guarantee they're N95 or better, but we do have them as a last resort.

\- Lights: Already had 6 lantern flashlights and 8 misc flashlights on hand, got new packages of AAA, AA, C, and D batteries as backups so I'm not worried about that. Also have 100 matchbooks and about 100 candles on hand as well.

\- 10 power banks (for phone or other use) fully charged.

\- Meds: my parents are getting their meds in order to see if they need refills on anything today, and I bought a 100ct bottle of Tylenol, 2 packages of Dayquil, and a 60ct bottle of multivitamins for myself. We already have a lot of other staple OTCs on hand, as well as 2 first aid kits, tons of bandaids and gauze, Neosporin, etc. I'm not worried about anything medication related as long as my parents can get their medications in order before or if SHTF.

\- Weapons: variety of handguns with sufficient ammo, just in case. Also set on things like hunting knives. Home security is very solid.

I probably missed some staple items in my running around so if anyone could clue me in to what I missed, I'd be very grateful. I also probably forgot to include some things we already have on this list, so I apologize for that up front.

My biggest worry is food, and I'm not positive I have enough in the event of power failures for whatever reason. I don't think we'd lose power, but in the event we did I'd like to know we'd be covered anyway.

The stores in my town aren't in a panic yet, though I have started to see people stock up on water from Costco and Walmart. Masks are completely out all over town, so that ship has sailed unless we get ours in the mail (should be here Monday).

Any help on other items I should get would be great, particularly in regard to food if you think I need to get more for all of us.

Thanks everyone, best of luck to you all, and I'm glad I found this community before things potentially get bad. Just as a starting point for myself and my family, you guys have already given me more information than I could have expected to prepare and stay

2254,If you want to get a solar generator get at least a 30 watt one with battery.,"Anything lower than that is pretty much a waste of time and money. You will never be able to charge your phone properly with less than 30 watts. I would even recommend if possible to go to 50 watts, which already provides more breathing room. 

With 50 watts generator and a day of sun you can charge a smartphone, use some led light blubs during night time. You can also power a small radio if needed for maybe half an hour if not more.

It's also very important to take a kit with a battery so you aren't forced to use the electricity during the day only.

Also remember that electricity is dangerous and you can hurt yourself.

2256,What are your little luxuries you’ll have in your prep?,"For us: my husband, me (pregnant), and our two very young daughters- things like, 
Chocolate syrup (easy hot cocoa, on desserts)
Bonne Maman jams (can be swirled into oatmeal, put on toast, used for baking cookies and breads)
Frozen fruit, I’m ripening bananas to freeze currently, too to make smoothies with
Chocolate chips, sprinkles, vanilla for baking 
Coffee, teas, alcohol, honey, maple 
Candy and chocolate bars, chips, granola bars
Specialty grains for varying our baking like rye, spelt 
Ghee 
Plenty of various spices for making home cooked food taste it’s best 
Homemade frozen bone and veggie scrap broth for soups 

Obviously this is assuming we keep power but so far, others have not lost power under quarantine so
I hope it remains the same. We still will have a lot of shelf stable items.

2269,How much food to prep for a dog?,"I have a question regarding how much food to prep for my dog.  He’s 60 lbs and growing puppy (9 months old) that eats about 2-3 cups of Purina pro plan sport salmon (496 kcal a cup).  He should be getting close to his adult weight so his food intake shouldn’t increase much more.  

His food went on sale so I just bought two 33 lbs bags that should last about 3 months.  I also have about 12 lbs of his food in a different flavor (he doesn’t care for it but in a pinch will work).  So I have about 4 months of food stockpiled.  I am on a budget working minimum wage and am worried that if shtf soon, that I won’t be able to get more than a medium size bag of the pro plan food, so maybe an extra month or so of food.  Of course, I could supplement a bit with the food for us if need be, but would rather not have to.

Would it be worth it to stock up on something like pedigree or dog chow as a last resort if things start looking rough instead of pro plan?  I know that it’s probably not the best thing to have him on long term but I just want to make sure he doesn’t go hungry.  How many months of food would you recommend stocking for one dog?  I’ll be taking him to get his bordetella vaccine (his only one due until September) and will try to get a 6 month supply of his heartworm if I can afford it.

2281,Useful insight in Corona situation,"A month ago China went in a major lockdown of multiple large provinces. We know a lot of people got infected and ill, but then again most people who were infected did not need to visit the hospital and recovered on their own or were hardly affected at all.

Unless you are immuno-suppressed or suffer from an existing respiratory illness or serious other medical ailment you will survive an infection, but probably feel terrible for a while if you are susceptible for this particular Corona virus and do get infected 

This is what will cause a lot of trouble around the world, people are not feeling well and either can't go to work for some time or need to take care of family who are not feeling well.

In actual fact it's this secondary effect that will bring the real disturbance to our daily lives. Businesses/education/government will close down because some of the staff is feeling unwell or need to take care of family and the others, the vast majority, are afraid of getting ill.

Although Maersk (a massive player in the container shipping world) has reported China has resumed producing goods and shipping volumes are recovering. A lot of goods will be in short supply or see price increases for the next weeks or months.

In summary, YES: Corona will severely upset daily lives for some time to come. All public events will probably be cancelled for the foreseeable future (forget about the Olympics), some stuff will be in short supply as local shops run out or because most truck drivers are unable or unwilling to work.

NO: You and your loved ones will most probably not die, but you will be spending more time at home and probably need to take care of family or spend some time in bed watching Netflix whilst feeling unwell for a while.

Things to do while everything is up and running:

Don't panic
Buy some supplies to last a few weeks, but don't clear out the entire supermarket
Buy comfort food for yourself and loved ones
Buy regular cold/flue/pain relief medicines
Buy supplies to take care of the DIY chores you have been putting off for months (paint the fence, fix a door)
Buy some books, board games and other entertainment 
And again don't panic, prepare, but don't freak out.

2288,Microeconomics... the forgotten resource,"Forgive me for not being resource laden and I’ll try to keep this brief. This is, my opinion, albeit an educated and experienced one.

1) supplementing food sources and household sources is wise.   Contributing to community resources is charity

2) Health consciousness is paramount.  Let’s not advise  people to eat and store like it’s the Walking Dead... especially when there are people that are worried and you’ve tucked away many calls in Reese’s alone

3) Firearms require training and time to master.  I don’t discourage anyone from protecting themselves.  A basic shotgun is the entry point and even that needs training. Learn about the Castle laws in your state and get damn well prepared to learn what you’re  doing

4) With all above being stated... don’t get caught up in others “prepping” fantasies and don’t feel less empowered because you don’t have what they have.  We can all  weather this storm. It’s time for us to stop shopping on Amazon and start supporting our local economies 

5) be prepared for social and economic disruptions. But also, be prepared to pick up the slack and make your communities/neighborhoods more viable and local as a result.

2298,Would you prep extra supplies for your neighbours/strangers? Why/Why not?,"So I was listening to an old Casual Preppers podcast recently (I love these guys!) and they mentioned how it might be worth setting aside extra supplies for neighbours/friends (or even shady people who appear on your doorstep) as a form of bartering (exchanging a different item) or to pacify them and get them off your back.

For example, you could set aside a few items in your preps specifically for them. But when you give it to them, really play it up and pretend that the small offering you have (a few jars of food and a jug of water) is really all you can afford to share with them.

Meanwhile, in reality, you have a very large amount of preps for yourself and your family that these other people don’t know about. 

The point is, it makes you look like you’re doing them a huge favor, ensuring they don’t leave empty handed (and not angering them so they don’t come back later to loot you) and hopefully, this could get them to go away without coming back.

2310,Observations from my second trip to Costco in four days,"As I have mentioned previously, I’ve been going to Costco weekly since this thing has started to get interesting. I’m largely done with my prep, but have been using Costco as a gauge for supply chain health, since they don’t warehouse and hold all stock in store, and to determine when those around me are starting to prepare. I was in there on Tuesday, and went again today. My Costco is the Mt Laurel, NJ location, which is roughly 30 minutes outside of Philadelphia. So from Tuesday to Friday, here’s what I noticed

First and foremost, they had a woman wiping down the handle of the carts with Clorox wipes as you came in.. that never been a thing. Costco is holding 26 less skids of water then they were 4 days ago. Toilet paper and paper towel stock was down around 35%. Rice was down 4 skids, and most of the fresh skids of beans I saw out on Tuesday, are now reaching their end and in need of replacement. I saw a man putting out a skid of the 5 count of Clorox wipes, and asked him how they’ve been selling, he mentioned that was the third skid he’s put out today. Surprisingly bleach was about where it was Tuesday, but Lysol spray has essentially been halved. They are now out of rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizer, and the cold and flu section is around half as stocked as it was four days ago. I also bought the third to last temporal thermometer.  

Primarily I was SHOCKED with how busy it was for a Friday around 1 o’clock. I’ve never seen it that busy outside of a Saturday afternoon. Looking around in the check out line, there were many folks prepping. There were quite a few folks with flag carts with just cases and cases of water, and dozens of roles of toilet paper. Here’s hoping they already had their food, because that’s not where I’d start.

I went today to establish a baseline going into the weekend. I’ll return again on Monday, and expect this to be the weekend where most folks start to do their buying. I’ll make a new post then to update everyone.

2312,Not enough room for toilet paper?,"Toilet paper takes up a lot of space, if you are tight on space or funds you can get plastic bottles called Peri Bottles that new moms are given at the hospital to help wash and soothe their bottoms after giving birth.  You just fill them with water and squirt the area you need to clean.  Right after birth you don't want to be wiping an area that is sore and may have stitches.  Then you can pat dry with a clean cloth or just a bit of toilet paper or just air dry.  They are inexpensive and you could use any type of bottle that has a squirt-not spray-nozzle and are soft and flexible to be able to squeeze the water out easily.  I imagine even the refillable picnic style ketchup/mustard bottles would work.

2317,4th day in Switzerland after first case detected,"Hello

Due to popular interest I decided to continue with the daily journal.

So today as you probably already know the Swiss government banned all public gathering with more than 1000 people. This lead to the cancelation of the Geneva motor show which is one of the biggest if not the biggest conference around cars and personal transportation.

This is quite big and to my knowledge unprecedented here in Switzerland. Usually we enjoy a lot of stability and personal freedom. It leads to a change in the way people talk about it and we start to realize how serious it could be. 

Where I work we had another official mail sent to us about if you traveled to a region with the virus they ask you to self quarantine for at least two weeks.

We have a subsidiary in China so we are in close contact with them and they are providing us with tips and how to set up home office on a bigger scale. Luckily the company has been promoting home office since a year now.

I'm tasked to come up with advice to be printed for our employees and I'm not sure yet what to write on them. This as led me to realize how WHO is in a very hard position of raising awareness but making sure people don't panic.

I must say I'm really glad the way my company proactively communicate to us in this difficult situation.

I just wanted to say thank you to everyone. I find positive to see everyone prepping in usually a pragmatic way, teaching to newcomers what to stockpile and how to store it :).

2324,First time prepper in North GA - do i have too much/not enough? opinions appreciated :),"I'm definitely the over-prepared worrier in my house. But i'm this way in general - I live by my daily planner, google calendar and my husband refers to my computer desk as my ""command center"" lol.  We're in GA (about 40 mins north of Atlanta) but moved here last year from FL, so i've hurricane prepped pretty regularly. As soon as I know hurricane is on its way or even a bad storm capable of producing tornadoes, I'll grab the emergency backpack (documents, batteries, emergency multi-tool, flashlights, weather radio, lighters,etc.), my bin of prepped food, water gallons, a ""baby"" bag with the kids stuff, and set up the closet/bathroom for us to hide out in. The thing is, I'm usually prepping a space for a day or two type of situation. This would be my first time prepping for this type of viral outbreak/possible quarantine situation. I honestly hadn't thought much of it until I happened upon this thread a few days ago and after the CDC update. 

I finally spoke to my husband about it this afternoon on his drive home from work and asked what he thinks about us starting to prep. He said from what he's heard from the news and other people at work (he works in a hospital), nobody seems to think we'll be that affected, including him. But he knows I can't rest when I'm overly anxious, so he said he's absolutely on board with stocking up. I set up a ""walmart grocery pick up slot"" for tomorrow afternoon. I'm already feeling sorry for the person who is shopping that list for me. I added everything that ive learned so far from this thread that i can think of and afford right now- groceries, personal hygiene products, cleaning products, otc medicine, paper products. My sweet husband even stopped at walmart on the way home and surprised me with 60 gallons of water! Yes sixty lol. I honestly dont know if that's too much or not enough for our family of 4. Now he's angling for one of those garage/chest freezers - saying we can store more frozen food. He's also been pushing for us to buy one of these freezers for years lol. Our fridge is on the small side but i've never gone two days without hitting a grocery store, so ive never seen a need for an extra freezer. And to be honest, we're not rolling in the dough. We make enough to live, pay our bills and a few extras here and there, but my walmart grocery pick up list for tomorrow is already at $360. I have no idea if this is all too much or not enough. I have no clue if the freezer thing is necessary or just a wasting another $200 plus whatever we're going to fill it with.

2332,Don't forget the peanut butter!,"I posted this about a month ago on a related subreddit but thought it could help people here.

I'd like to just briefly extol the benefits of peanut butter. I can get a 18oz jar from Walmart for $1.58 which is just under 9 cents an ounce. That cheap little jar will last several years and provide 2,880 in one compact, easy-to eat, delicious and filling package. I'm sure this isn't too healthy, but I have gone several days eating only out of a jar of peanut butter (being a bachelor) and felt fine. It is actually high in potassium, protein and has fiber, healthy fats, magnesium, vitamin E and antioxidants. I'd want to have other food on hand, but after comparing the price of a few of those jars with other expensive food (like an $80 bucket of freeze dried food that has under 8k calories), having plenty of peanut butter in my pantry is a no-brainer for me. I just have to hide it from myself so I don't eat it all too early. It is definitely not something I have to remind myself to rotate in. 

Unopened peanut butter can stay shelf stable 6 to 12 months AFTER the expiration date or even longer.  I keep mine in the fridge.  Natural peanut butter does not last as nearly as long (2-3 months past best by date instead of a year).

The UK now has 'community transmission' just outside London - in other words, uncontrolled and uncontrollable (though currently still small) spread. This will undoubtedly accelerate in the next few days, especially since London is a megacity which cannot be locked down like an Italian village. If the UK follows Italy, we will have several hundred by mid-March, a thousand by late March, and tens of thousands by Easter. 

I'm not saying that we shouldn't all still prepare for quarantine and subsequent food shortages, etc. - we clearly must - but that is not going to be enough. Even 6 months of supplies is unlikely to shield you from this, as it will be circulating in the community for the next year, most likely (and possibly forever). My view is thus that we should all now be preparing to contract the virus, and hence changing our thinking from prevention strategies to coping strategies. 

We therefore need a more active discussion of what to do whilst ill - e.g. good foods to have on hand for recovery, how to make it as easy as possible to cope at home whilst ill, plans for home care and hospital admission, what to do with pets, how best to involve children in caring for adults, giving kids an emergency phone to call relatives, and so on. 

Beyond that, we also need to start thinking of a 'Survivors Corps' - recovered individuals whom we can rapidly allocate to critical roles and take advantage of their period of immunity. That may be best co-ordinated on a community level, and clearly not feasible for a month or two, but it would be helpful for us to be thinking now about what volunteer organisations - churches, Scouts, rotary, etc - might help co-ordinate such groups. Individual responsibility is great - and most of us on this sub clearly take it seriously - but at some point we also need to think beyond individual, atomistic actions. It is those communities that bind together which will survive best.",PandemicPreps,1582987553,cdh1001,17,1,True,2020-02-29 06:45:53,get people want share pics pantry comforting makes feel bit better might possibly inspire others imo need thinking beyond supplies towards post infection actions procedures communities uk community transmission outside london words uncontrolled uncontrollable though currently still small spread undoubtedly accelerate next days especially since london megacity cannot locked like italian village uk follows italy several hundred mid march thousand late march tens thousands easter saying still prepare quarantine subsequent food shortages etc clearly must going enough even months supplies unlikely shield circulating community next year likely possibly forever view thus preparing contract virus hence changing thinking prevention strategies coping strategies therefore need active discussion whilst ill e g good foods hand recovery make easy possible cope home whilst ill plans home care hospital admission pets best involve children caring adults giving kids emergency phone call relatives also need start thinking survivors corps recovered individuals rapidly allocate critical roles take advantage period immunity may best co ordinated community level clearly feasible month two would helpful us thinking volunteer organisations churches scouts rotary etc might help co ordinate groups individual responsibility great us sub clearly take seriously point also need think beyond individual atomistic actions communities bind together survive best,get peopl want share pic pantri comfort make feel bit better might possibl inspir other imo need think beyond suppli toward post infect action procedur commun uk commun transmiss outsid london word uncontrol uncontrol though current still small spread undoubtedli acceler next day especi sinc london megac cannot lock like italian villag uk follow itali sever hundr mid march thousand late march ten thousand easter say still prepar quarantin subsequ food shortag etc clearli must go enough even month suppli unlik shield circul commun next year like possibl forev view thu prepar contract viru henc chang think prevent strategi cope strategi therefor need activ discuss whilst ill e g good food hand recoveri make easi possibl cope home whilst ill plan home care hospit admiss pet best involv children care adult give kid emerg phone call rel also need start think survivor corp recov individu rapidli alloc critic role take advantag period immun may best co ordin commun level clearli feasibl month two would help us think volunt organis church scout rotari etc might help co ordin group individu respons great us sub clearli take serious point also need think beyond individu atomist action commun bind togeth surviv best

2343,Your friendly feminine hygiene reminder,"I figure it probably can't be said enough, but periods are going to happen whether you like it or not during a pandemic. So here are some effective ways to deal with that without relying on disposable pads and tampons:

Menstrual Cups - You don't have to purchase a Diva Cup specifically, I know some of those ""name brand"" type menstrual cups can be expensive. Consider hopping onto Amazon and searching ""menstrual cup"". There will be a wide selection of options, some more cost effective. I know last year I purchased a set of two for less than the price of one Diva Cup through Amazon. These are nice because they last for years and you can keep reusing them. Just make sure to boil them for at least 30 minutes once a month (just after your period ends) to keep them clean enough for monthly use. If you're unfamiliar with menstrual cups, they can be very uncomfortable during your first use. Look up videos about how to properly insert it to keep from having a painful first try at it. As long as you get a good seal and empty the cup at least every 12 hours, you'll be golden!

Cloth Pads - Yes you'll have to wash them after you use them, and no, no one enjoys it. But you don't have the extra waste to deal with, and once washed, you can use them again. Cloth pads also tend to absorb more which is so nice if you bleed heavily. Depending on the kind you get, they can be a bit bulky, which will feel weird to wear for a while. Don't worry, you'll get use to it. And you'll be very happy to have them around if you were to run out of disposables. These are easy to find on Amazon or other online retailers. If you have an eco friendly store in your are, they also probably carry them.

Period Underwear - I'm sure if you're a woman, you've at least seen one ad for period specific underwear. I personally own a number of Thinx brand period underwear. They work great for me! I know that Thinx in particular have different levels of underwear that correspond to how much they hold (absorb). And there are a lot of other brands out there too, Thinx is far from the only one. That just happens to be the only kind I personally have and speak directly about. Just like cloth pads, you will have to wash them (and make sure you do NOT put them in the dryer because it will affect absorbency). But again, no trash to worry about and you can keep reusing them.

Midol - if you are like me and have painful cramps, you may want to remember to stock up on Midol (or other generic brands of the same things) to help combat the cramps. But there is another possible option listed just underneath this.

Livia (or another TENs unit) - again, if you are like me, this is a great investment! If you're worried about long term not being able to get your hands on Midol but think you'll have access to electricity still, Livia is a great device for menstrual pain. It's basically a TENs unit. I personally like the small size of the Livia, which is why I invested in it instead of any old TENs unit. But that's just my choice.

I've used all of the above products for a least a year and no longer have any need for purchasing disposable period products. Is it probably a good idea to have some on hand in your prepping supplies? Yes. But if you were caught in a long term situation, you would eventually run out. So these options are amazing alternatives that many woman use every single month already.

Now lets talk pregnancy ladies!

If you are currently pregnant, you definitely have some other needs to worry about. But let me get started with this first: If you are currently pregnant and due any time soon, you need to be prepared for the chance that you may not be able to get to a hospital when the baby comes.

Hopefully that will not be the case, but you may want to at least consider it and make some plans accordingly.

Now let's talk about care once you've had a baby:

You'll want to have some of the following on hand to help deal with the pain, swelling, and overall general terribleness of having just had a child: Maxi Pads (you will 100% want the largest pads you've ever seen), ice packs (you will definitely be putting them down there), witch hazel pads (might sound weird, but holy crap do these things help!), a peri bottle (do not forget about this, because you will thank yourself so much for having it on hand), large underwear (where else are you going to fit the layers of maxi pads, ice packs, and witch hazel pads?), nursing bras (or bras that at least have some room because you'll probably experience swelling), Lidocaine spray (this was a life safer in combination with the witch hazel pads), and possibly other things that I haven't listed here.

But if you're in early pregnancy, you have different needs to worry about here. Make sure that you have something to curb morning sickness. There are a range of products that might help. If your already pregnant, you may already be familiar with them. Look into specially made lollipops for easing morning sickness, have extra crackers on hand to help your stomach feel more settled, get a set of sea sickness bands (oddly enough, they helped me a little even though I didn't think they would possibly work). Also, just anything that you know helps you in particular. Stock up on some foods that you know you can get yourself to at least eat if you have to while feeling the morning sickness rushing through. And don't forget to make sure you have clothing that will fit you in a couple of months at least. It's crazy how quickly your size can change while pregnant. Don't forget, some women can manage in their regular clothing throughout pregnancy, but some women absolutely have to get larger (or pregnancy specific) pants and what not. For foot pain and swelling, I always had good results from soaking in water with some lavender oil in it. I'm not a big oil will cure things person, but I do find the smells of some of them to be relaxing, and the lavender did seem to make a bit of a difference for me.

MOST IMPORTANTLY: just don't forget to prep what you think/know will make you feel better during your period or during your pregnancy.

AND FOR DADS OF TEEN GIRLS: please for the love of everything out there, if you are prepping, make sure your daughters have what they need. I'm sure it isn't the first thing on every guys mind, but it will be a necessity for your daughters if they are of that age and have already started their periods or may be starting them anytime

2347,Critique My Prep List,"Hi all,

I don't know if this type of post is allowed or encouraged - I guess to many of these could become spammy. Delete or downvote if not appropriate.

However, I could really do with some people pointing out holes in my prep list - its something I'm hoping to send to my extended family. For a bit of context - we are in the UK and most of my family lives on the same suburban estate. Bug out is not an option, neither are guns or a lot of drugs like antibiotics.

&amp;#x200B;

# Health

* One thermometer per person
* Pulse Oximeter (allows measuring oxygen levels in blood) **MOST IMPORTANT AND ALSO CHEAP**
* Blood Pressure monitor

*(the above is to assess the condition of anyone sick. This will determine if and when to call the doctor and also lets you describe condition in detail)*

Top up on any prescriptions (this is apparently possible through NHS)

Multivitamin one a day per person

Vitamin D 2 a day per person (you can’t overdose on vitamin D - first few days take extra)

Decongestants may be helpful

Steamer may help clear nose and throat of mucous

Consider paracetamol and ibruprofen but I would recommend not using these as a fever is a beneficial immune reaction.

# Cleaning and Toiletries

* 10 L of bleach
* 5 spray bottles of bleach
* 5 l of washing up liquid
* 30 bottle of handwash
* 10 bottles of hand sanitizer
* Sufficient Hand lotion (lots of washing causes cracks in skin)
* 100 latex rubber gloves
* 50 non-latex gloves (these might not be as effective but in case you develop an allergy)
* 10 botlles of shower gel
* 60 rolls of toilet paper
* 20 rolls of kitchen roll
* Empty spray bottle or lawn sprayer
* 5 rolls of bin bags

# Food

* 30 kg rice
* 10 kg pasta
* 20 kg of assorted chickpeas, beans, lentils etc.
* 30 cans of fish or meat
* 40 cans of fruit such as peaches
* 30 cans green vegetables
* 10 cans carrots
* 40 cans soup
* 5 kg sugar
* 5kg salt
* 10 litres of olive oil
* 20 cans coconut milk
* 10 cans of ghee or lard
* Spices and condiments
* Onions for freezing ( chop up or can buy pre-chopped)
* Chocolate or nutella (a lot)
* Tea Bags
* Long Life milk
* Frozen vegetables
* Frozen meat

# Protection 

* Masks 

For healthy people N95 masks prevent breathing virus in 

For sick people surgeons mask prevent breathing virus out

* Eye googles - swim goggles or DIY or Skiing
* Rain coat with hood and Waterproof trousers
* Disposable gloves
* Wellies
* Hospital overalls are actually cheap and could be used when treating a sick person
* Other Stuff  

* Masking tape
* Bin Bags
* Tools
* Get more bins

2354,What are you preparing for and why?,"I am a long time lurker of various prepping forums, and watch the same History channel shows as the next guy. What I have realized is that everyone is preparing for something different. Some people are worried about some outcomes more than others, while some families have specific needs that others may not have. Some things may depend on your home, your community network, your local climate, etc. 

What is everyone here preparing for and why?    


I think because this is PandemicPreps, there should be many common threads between preps, but not all.  I am interested to know what everyone is doing to prepare, not just purchases, and the reasoning behind it.

2359,Honest Question,"Why are many people expecting power outages and/or water contamination/loss of water during COVID-19 pandemic? 

It’s an honest question and I’d like to understand people’s reasoning as maybe I’m overlooking something important. I keep hearing people say they are ready for the coming power outages or seeing it online.

I’ve been following news and individual reports from hard hit areas and quarantined areas, and there does not appear to be any shut down of power plants or water treatment plants. Nor did there appear to be such disruptions during SARS or even Ebola hit areas. Essential personnel for critical services were/are always working. So I’m genuinely wondering.

Of course it’s important to be prepared for power outages at any time (hurricane, earthquake, blizzard, tornado, etc.) and we are already prepared, as we have been through a few bad storm outages over the years.",PandemicPreps,1583020508,Jules6146,25,1,True,2020-02-29 15:55:08,many people expecting power outages water contamination loss water covid pandemic honest question like understand people reasoning maybe overlooking something important keep hearing people say ready coming power outages seeing online following news individual reports hard hit areas quarantined areas appear shut power plants water treatment plants appear disruptions sars even ebola hit areas essential personnel critical services always working genuinely wondering course important prepared power outages time hurricane earthquake blizzard tornado etc already prepared bad storm outages years,mani peopl expect power outag water contamin loss water covid pandem honest question like understand peopl reason mayb overlook someth import keep hear peopl say readi come power outag see onlin follow news individu report hard hit area quarantin area appear shut power plant water treatment plant appear disrupt sar even ebola hit area essenti personnel critic servic alway work genuin wonder cours import prepar power outag time hurrican earthquak blizzard tornado etc alreadi prepar bad storm outag year
2360,We’ve been trying to solve this problem for years. Can someone smarter please help?,"My husband’s been an ER RN for 20 years. He’s also been a Type 1 diabetic since he was 6.

Last month we refreshed our supply on old items, but we’re still banging our heads against the same and most important subject: a solar mini fridge for his insulin if we lose power. 

I feel so dumb and overwhelmed when I try to understand what we need. If we had a house we’d have a root cellar or a giant generator.
